Abstract

Training deep research agents—systems that plan, search, evaluate evidence, and synthesize long-form reports—pushes reinforcement
learning beyond the regime of verifiable rewards. Their outputs lack ground-truth answers, their trajectories span many tool-augmented
decisions, and standard post-training offers little mechanism for turning past attempts into reusable experience. In this work, we argue that
rubrics should serve not merely as final-answer evaluators, but as the shared interface that structures policy execution, judge feedback, and
agent memory. Based on this view, we introduce RubricEM, a rubric-guided reinforcement learning framework that combines stagewise policy
decomposition with reflection-based meta-policy training. RubricEM first makes research trajectories stage-aware by conditioning planning,
evidence gathering, review, and synthesis on self-generated rubrics. It then assigns credit with Stage-Structured GRPO, which uses stagewise
rubric judgments to provide denser semantic feedback for long-horizon optimization. In parallel, RubricEM trains a shared-backbone reflection
meta-policy that distills judged trajectories into reusable rubric-grounded guidance for future attempts. The resulting RubricEM-8B achieves
strong performance across four representative long-form research benchmarks, outperforming comparable open models and approaching proprietary
deep-research systems. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough analyses to understand the key ingredients of RubricEM.


1 Introduction
--------------

Deep research agents answer complex information-seeking questions by autonomously planning, searching, evaluating evidence, and synthesizing
long-form reports. Yet how to train this capability remains unclear: proprietary systems such as Gemini and OpenAI’s deep research (google2025gemini;
openai2025deepresearch) reveal little about their methodology, while most existing efforts rely on verifiable search proxies (jin2025searchr1;
song2025r1searcher; nguyen2025sfrdeepresearch) or high-quality imitation data (tongyi2025deepresearch; moonshot2025kimiresearcher;
perplexity2025sonardeepresearch). End-to-end RL for long-form research is difficult because outputs lack ground-truth verification, judge
feedback is coarse and delayed over long tool-augmented rollouts, and conventional post-training mostly converts judged attempts into
parametric updates without producing explicit reusable guidance. This raises the central question of this work:

[Uncaptioned image] How can reinforcement learning train deep research agents beyond verifiable rewards, while enabling long-horizon credit
assignment and learning from experience?

Rubrics offer a natural handle for open-ended tasks whose quality cannot be verified by exact answers (gunjal2025rubrics; shao2025dr;
chen2025rm). Prior work mainly uses them as judge-side criteria for assigning rewards to final responses. Our key perspective is that rubrics
should instead serve as a shared interface throughout reinforcement learning. The same criteria that define success can guide the agent’s
planning and search, support process-level judgment over intermediate decisions, and be distilled into reusable reflections for learning from
experience. Based on this view, we propose RubricEM, a rubric-guided reinforcement learning framework that combines stagewise policy
decomposition with reflection-based meta-policy evolution. The name RubricEM reflects an Expectation–Maximization (EM)-inspired
estimate–maximize view (dempster1977em) (beyond supervised settings): the latent structure of an open-ended research task—what matters,
where credit belongs, and what should be remembered—is estimated through rubrics, which condition policy reasoning, judge scoring, and
memory evolution. Training then maximizes the task policy and reflection meta-policy under these rubric-conditioned estimates.

RubricEM first realizes rubric-guided policy decomposition through a rubric-guided reasoning scaffold. During planning, the agent generates
task-specific rubrics and carries them through four stages: planning, research, review, and answer synthesis. This converts a flat
long-horizon rollout into rubric-conditioned decision stages, where each stage defines both a distinct decision mode and a natural unit for
optimization. The scaffold also makes rubrics operational across the training loop: they guide search and synthesis, serve as on-policy
references for the judge, and produce structured traces that can be distilled into reusable reflections.

Building on this decomposition, RubricEM assigns credit with Stage-Structured GRPO (SS-GRPO). Rather than broadcast a single terminal score
to all tokens, SS-GRPO scores Plan, Research, Review, and Answer with stage-specific rubrics. The judge maintains an evolving rubric buffer
for each stage, extending prior evolving-rubric evaluation (shao2025dr) from final-answer judging to process-level feedback. These stagewise
scores define denser returns that combine local stage quality with downstream impact, giving GRPO finer-grained credit signals while
remaining critic-free.

Refer to caption Figure 1: RubricEM first instills a rubric-guided structured scaffold into the task policy, so that each trajectory follows
stage-structured reasoning under self-generated rubrics. During RL, we propose Stage-Structured GRPO to provide finer-grained, denser credit
assignment. In parallel, a shared-backbone reflection meta-policy is jointly trained to generate rubric-grounded reflections, which are
stored in a rubric bank to support both cross-episode transfer and within-episode refinement. Together, rubrics serve as the shared interface
across the agent, the judge, and their evolutions.

Finally, RubricEM makes experience reuse an explicit RL objective through Reflection Meta-Policy training. The task policy and reflection
meta-policy share one backbone: after a task rollout is judged, the backbone samples rubric-grounded reflection candidates conditioned only
on the query and raw trajectory, while a separate judge scores these candidates using the task-rollout judgments. The reflection scores
provide auxiliary RL rewards on reflection tokens, updating the shared parameters; the highest-scored accepted reflection is also written
into an agent rubric bank as natural-language memory. The bank conditions future rollouts in two modes: within-episode refinement retrieves
the previous reflection for the same query, while cross-episode transfer retrieves reflections from related questions. Thus, each reflection
updates the agent both parametrically and textually. We designed an efficient asynchronous reflection branch to train this meta-policy
alongside task-policy RL without adding a sequential bottleneck, a notable problem in prior meta-RL literature (jiang2026metarl).

Together, these components yield RubricEM-8B, an 8B deep research agent trained with 1400 RL steps. Fig. 1 gives an overview of the
framework, and Fig. 2 illustrates a concrete example. Across four representative long-form research benchmarks, RubricEM-8B achieves
state-of-the-art performance among comparable open models, improves over strong prior RL systems with fewer training steps, and approaches
proprietary deep-research systems such as Gemini and OpenAI Deep Research. Beyond final scores, we conduct extensive ablations and analyses,
including multiple 600-step RL ablations, scaffold comparisons, inference scaling, and out-of-domain short-form transfer. These results
support a broader recipe for long-horizon RL beyond verifiable rewards: expose task structure, assign credit to that structure, and convert
judged attempts into reusable experience.

Refer to caption Figure 2: Example of the rubric-guided stage-structured search agent trajectory, meta-policy reflection, and stagewise judge
rubrics during a single RL step.


2 Related Work

The Post-training recipes of deep research agents. Most existing open-source training efforts for deep research focus on short-answer tasks
with verifiable rewards (jin2025searchr1; song2025r1searcher; chen2025research; jiang2025deepretrieval; zhao2025rsearch; han2025deep).
Meanwhile, proprietary systems mainly report scaling high-quality imitation data and training on verifiable short-form settings (openai2025deepresearch;
google2025geminideepresearch; perplexity2025sonardeepresearch; moonshot2025kimiresearcher). Our work takes an orthogonal direction: making
reinforcement learning effective for open-ended, long-form deep research. The closest work to ours is DR Tulu (shao2025dr), which studies
end-to-end RL for deep research beyond verifiable rewards. We build on this foundation by introducing fine-grained credit assignment and
jointly trained meta-policy evolution, yielding denser learning signals and reusable guidance during the challenging long-horizon RL process.

Credit assignment and meta-RL with language models. Recent work on agentic reinforcement learning has increasingly emphasized the need for
finer-grained credit assignment (mousavi2026post; deepseek2026v4; qian2025toolrl; xi2026agentprm; zhang2026reasoning). However, most of these
methods operate in verifiable settings, where trajectories can be decomposed into subgoals with reliable process-level supervision. A related
line of work trains meta-policies during reinforcement learning, often referred to as Meta-RL (jiang2026metarl; yang2026mage). While
promising, these methods are typically evaluated on verifiable or synthetic tasks and often introduce explicit dependencies across rollouts,
leading to substantial training overhead. In contrast, our work targets open-ended real-world deep research tasks, where neither intermediate
progress nor final answers admit simple automatic verification. We improve meta-policy training efficiency by removing cross-rollout
dependencies and designing an efficient reflection-training infrastructure.


3 RubricEM
----------


3.1 Preliminaries and notations

We study deep research agents for complex information-seeking queries. Given a query q∼𝒟q\sim\mathcal{D}, an agent interacts with a tool
environment 𝒯\mathcal{T} and produces a trajectory τ=(a1,o1,…,aT,oT),\tau=(a_{1},o_{1},\dots,a_{T},o_{T}), where ata_{t} denotes the
agent emission at turn tt, which may be either a textual segment or a structured tool call, and oto_{t} is the resulting tool output (with
ot=∅o_{t}=\varnothing when no tool is invoked). We consider a language-model-based agent that autoregressively samples the next step
at∼πθ​(at∣ht),ht=(q,a<t,o<t),a_{t}\sim\pi_{\theta}(a_{t}\mid h_{t}),h_{t}=(q,a_{<t},o_{<t}), and eventually produces a final
long-form answer grounded in retrieved evidence.


3.2 Structured Reasoning Scaffold

A central design choice in RubricEM is to impose explicit stage structure on agent trajectories. A stage refers to a semantically defined
segment of the trajectory that serves a distinct decision role, such as planning, evidence gathering, self-evaluation, or final synthesis. In
long-horizon research tasks, these stages provide a stable high-level organization over otherwise noisy token-level generation. When these
decision modes are collapsed into a flat autoregressive process, the trajectory lacks such stage-level organization. The policy must
therefore infer its current decision mode from local context alone, which can lead to inefficient exploration and compounding errors over
long horizons (xu2025cognitive; feng2026environment). We formalize the value of explicit stage information as follows. Let hh denote a random
decision point along a trajectory induced by the current policy, let c=ϕ​(h)c=\phi(h) denote a compressed state representation, let zz
denote the current stage label, and let U​(h,a)U(h,a) denote the expected downstream value of taking action aa at history hh and then
continuing the rollout.

Theorem 1 (Value of stage information).

Under mild assumptions in Assump. 1, define

Vflat:=𝔼​[maxa∈𝒜⁡𝔼​[U​(h,a)∣c]],Vstage:=𝔼​[maxa∈𝒜⁡𝔼​[U​(h,a)∣c,z]].V_{\mathrm{flat}}:=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\mathbb{E}[U(h,a)\mid
c]\right],\qquad V_{\mathrm{stage}}:=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\mathbb{E}[U(h,a)\mid c,z]\right].

If there exists a measurable set 𝒞0\mathcal{C}_{0} with positive probability and two task-relevant stages such that for every
c∈𝒞0c\in\mathcal{C}_{0}, p​(z∣c)>0p(z\mid c)>0, p​(z′∣c)>0p(z^{\prime}\mid c)>0, and that
arg⁡maxa∈𝒜⁡𝔼​[U​(h,a)∣c,z]∩arg⁡maxa∈𝒜⁡𝔼​[U​(h,a)∣c,z′]=∅.\arg\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\mathbb{E}[U(h,a)\mid
c,z]\;\cap\;\arg\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\mathbb{E}[U(h,a)\mid c,z^{\prime}]=\varnothing. Then

Vstage>Vflat.V_{\mathrm{stage}}>V_{\mathrm{flat}}.

Theorem 1 identifies when explicit stage information is beneficial. In long-horizon research trajectories, the same local context may call
for different actions across planning, searching, reviewing, and final synthesis. When these stage-specific optimal actions disagree, a flat
policy acts under an aliased context, whereas a stage-aware policy can condition on the current decision mode. This yields a strict value
improvement on any positive-probability set where such aliasing occurs. We therefore make stage structure explicit rather than implicit in a
flat trajectory. The proof is deferred to Appen. E.1.

Specific stage instantiation. We instantiate this idea with four rubric-guided stages:
Plan→Research→Review→Answer.\textsc{Plan}\rightarrow\textsc{Research}\rightarrow\textsc{Review}\rightarrow\textsc{Answer}. Each stage
is marked by a stage-level XML tag with a lightweight internal schema. The outer scaffold is sequential, while Research allows local
iteration and in-place plan revision. The overview is in Fig. 3 and detailed below:

Plan. Within <structured_plan>, the agent analyzes the user’s explicit and implicit needs in <analysis>, translates them into <rubrics>,
and then proposes a concrete <research_plan>. The rubrics specify (i) a knowledge checklist of information to gather, (ii) analytical
criteria for the final write-up, and (iii) negative constraints on what the answer should avoid.

Research. The agent iteratively issues <call_tool> actions. After each tool response, the agent performs a <state_evaluation> step, which
compares the accumulated evidence against the plan and rubrics, decides whether further search is needed, and optionally revises the Plan in
place.

Review. Within <review>, the agent maps collected evidence back to the rubrics through
<rubrics_review> and prepares a writing plan, including the main thesis and section outline.

Answer. Within <answer>, the agent synthesizes the final long-form response with citation support.

Refer to caption Figure 3: Rubric-guided structured reasoning scaffold in RubricEM. The agent follows a high-level workflow of Plan,
Research, Review, and Answer, each with a lightweight internal schema. Rubrics are generated in Plan and then guide evidence collection,
evaluation, and final writing. During Research, the agent iterates between tool use and state evaluation; once evidence is sufficient, it
enters Review and then produces the final grounded Answer. The full description is in Appen. B.1

Importantly, rubrics are not merely evaluation artifacts in RubricEM: they are generated in Plan, can be revised during Research, and guide
subsequent stages throughout the trajectory. This instantiation is motivated by three considerations. First, it is task-aligned: deep
research naturally involves planning, evidence acquisition, self-evaluation, and synthesis, so the four stages reflect the task rather than
an arbitrary template. Second, explicit criteria give the policy a stable target for planning, self-checking, and feedback, echoing
rubric-based learning and explicit-principle approaches (panadero2017review; tai2018developing; bai2022constitutional). Third, because
self-generated rubrics vary across rollouts of the same query, they provide per-rollout references that help the judge discover more aligned
and discriminative stagewise criteria. We validate the effectiveness of the scaffold and its importance for RL in Sec. 5.2.

Finally, the scaffold directly enables our later RL design: stage boundaries define the units for SS-GRPO credit assignment, and
rubric-conditioned traces define the memory format for the rubric bank (Sec. 3.4). We therefore view the scaffold not as a formatting
warm-up, but as an SFT-induced structural prior that prepares the policy for effective RL (zhang2026good).

SFT distillation. To instantiate the scaffold in the policy, we perform teacher–student distillation from Gemini-3.1-Pro. For each query,
the teacher is prompted to produce a stage-structured trajectory that follows the XML schema above. Because raw teacher traces do not always
obey the target scaffold, we apply rejection sampling to discard outputs that violate stage boundaries, tool-calling syntax, citation format,
or grounding constraints. The resulting SFT corpus teaches Qwen3-8B not only tool use and evidence citation, but also the stage discipline
and rubric conditioning required by our later RL design. We defer details of the data-generation and filtering pipeline to Append. B.2.


3.3 Stage-Structured GRPO

Building on the structured scaffold above, we propose Stage-Structured GRPO (SS-GRPO) for finer-grained credit assignment in deep research.
Prior work on process supervision and long-horizon agent RL suggests that denser process-level rewards can substantially improve credit
assignment (yang2026patching; tan2026hindsight; qian2025toolrl; wu2026demystifying; wang2026subgoal). However, in open-ended deep research,
we do not have oracle intermediate rewards: the quality of planning, search, review, and synthesis is semantic, task-dependent, and difficult
to verify automatically. SS-GRPO therefore uses the explicit stage boundaries from Sec. 3.2 together with rubric-guided judging to construct
stage-level learning signals, as illustrated in Fig. 4.

Stagewise scores and returns. Given a query qq, we sample nn rollouts
{τi}i=1n∼πθ(⋅∣q)\{\tau_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\sim\pi_{\theta}(\cdot\mid q) and partition each into KK semantic stages; in our
instantiation, K=4K=4 corresponding to Plan, Research, Review, and Answer. Let ℬi,k\mathcal{B}_{i,k} be the tokens in stage kk of rollout
τi\tau_{i}, and let Ri,k∈[0,1]R_{i,k}\in[0,1] be the LLM-judge score under the corresponding stage rubric. Rather than assign the same
final score to all tokens, SS-GRPO uses a causal stage-dependence matrix Λ=(λk,j)\Lambda=(\lambda_{k,j}), with λk,j=0\lambda_{k,j}=0 for
j<kj<k and λk,k=1\lambda_{k,k}=1, and defines Gi,kΛ=∑j=kKλk,j​Ri,j.G^{\Lambda}_{i,k}=\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}R_{i,j}. Thus each
stage keeps its own score while receiving credit from downstream stages it enables. Terminal reward broadcast is considered a special case.

When stage returns help. The benefit of stage returns depends on a simple trade-off: intermediate judging recovers process information
omitted by terminal-only rewards, but also introduces judge noise. Appendix E.2, Thm. 3 formalizes this intuition: stage-weighted credit
improves the gradient approximation when the recovered intermediate signal outweighs cumulative judge misalignment. Thus SS-GRPO needs no
oracle process reward, only sufficiently aligned stagewise judging with bounded noise. This motivates the stagewise evolving-rubric judge
below.

Stagewise evolving-rubric judge. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 4, the judge contrasts multiple rollouts for the same query and proposes
discriminative rubrics for each stage. The judge maintains a separate rubric buffer for Plan, Research, Review, and Answer, reuses previous
high-discrimination rubrics, and removes items that no longer separate trajectory quality. Because the policy trajectories are themselves
rubric-guided, the judge can also use trajectory-generated rubrics as references when constructing new judge rubrics, while still scoring
trajectories against the judge-side rubric buffer rather than blindly rewarding a rollout’s own self-rubric. This makes the intermediate
rewards both stage-local and adaptive to the current policy distribution. Further details are deferred to Append. C

Stagewise normalization and objective. We instantiate SS-GRPO as a critic-free stagewise variant of GRPO by normalizing returns separately
within each stage across the rollout group:

Ai,k=Gi,kΛ−1n​∑i′=1nGi′,kΛStdi′⁡[Gi′,kΛ]+ϵ.A_{i,k}=\frac{G_{i,k}^{\Lambda}-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i^{\prime}=1}^{n}G_{i^{\prime},k}^{\Lambda}}{\operatorname{Std}_{i^{\prime}}[G_{i^{\prime},k}^{\Lambda}]+\epsilon}.

All tokens in the same stage block ℬi,k\mathcal{B}_{i,k} share the advantage Ai,kA_{i,k}. The resulting objective is

ℒSS​-​GRPO=−1n​∑i=1n∑k=1K∑t∈ℬi,kmin⁡(ρi,t​Ai,k,clip⁡(ρi,t,1−η,1+η)​Ai,k)+β​DKL​(πθ∥πref),\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{SS\text{-}GRPO}}=-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{t\in\mathcal{B}_{i,k}}\min\!\Big(\rho_{i,t}A_{i,k},\operatorname{clip}(\rho_{i,t},1-\eta,1+\eta)A_{i,k}\Big)+\beta
D_{\mathrm{KL}}(\pi_{\theta}\,\|\,\pi_{\mathrm{ref}}),

(1)

where ρi,t=πθ​(ai,t∣hi,t)πθold​(ai,t∣hi,t).\rho_{i,t}=\frac{\pi_{\theta}(a_{i,t}\mid
h_{i,t})}{\pi_{\theta_{\mathrm{old}}}(a_{i,t}\mid h_{i,t})}. We keep the estimator critic-free because stage supervision is judge-defined,
evolving during training, and collected from expensive long-horizon tool-augmented rollouts; adding a learned stage-conditioned critic would
introduce substantial additional complexity.


3.4 Meta-Policy Training with Reinforcement Learning

Beyond single-trajectory optimization, RubricEM makes experience reuse part of RL. A shared backbone serves as both the task policy and a
reflection meta-policy: rubric-guided task rollouts provide judged experience, and the reflection policy is trained with LLM-judge rewards to
produce reusable natural-language guidance. Accepted reflections enter an agent rubric bank for future retrieval, giving the agent both
parametric RL updates and textual memory updates. This retains the meta-RL goal of improving future rollouts from past experience, while our
asynchronous design avoids a sequential rollout–reflection–update bottleneck.

Refer to caption Figure 4: Detailed RL training pipeline of RubricEM. The top panel expands Fig. 1 with two coupled judge-agent loops. For
task-policy training, an LLM judge contrasts stage-structured rollouts to build a buffer of discriminative stagewise rubrics, which provide
dense stagewise rewards for SS-GRPO. For reflection meta-policy training, a sampled trajectory and query prompt multiple candidate
reflections; the judge scores all candidates using its accumulated rubrics and trajectory scores under within-episode and cross-episode
criteria. These scores update the meta-policy, and only the best reflection is written to the agent rubric bank. The bottom panel shows the
asynchronous implementation, where reflection rollout, judging, and update run on previous trajectories to avoid synchronous overhead.
Details are provided in Appen. C and D; Alg. 1 gives the formal procedure.

Joint training of the reflection meta-policy. After task-policy rollouts are judged, we sample a query–trajectory pair and prompt the
shared backbone to generate multiple reflection candidates, treating the trajectory as fixed context and backpropagating only through
reflection tokens. A privileged LLM judge scores every candidate using the original question, raw trajectory, stagewise rubric scores, and
evaluator justifications from task-rollout judging. These scores assess whether each reflection is useful for within-episode refinement and
cross-episode transfer; all candidate scores provide RL signals for updating the reflection meta-policy, while only the highest-scored
accepted reflection is written into the agent rubric bank. Because the reflection generator and task policy share the same backbone, this
reflection-side objective becomes an auxiliary RL signal for the task policy rather than a purely inference-time memory mechanism. Appendix
E.3 formalizes the positive-transfer case where judge-scored reflection updates are aligned on average with future task improvement.

Coupled agent–judge co-evolution. The reflection loop is coupled with the stagewise evolving judge from Sec. 3.3. On-policy rollouts expose
new criteria and failure modes, which update the judge-side stagewise rubric buffer; the updated judge then scores both task trajectories and
reflection candidates. Accepted reflections return to the agent through the rubric bank and condition future rollouts. Thus, the agent
evolves through policy and rubric-bank updates, while the judge evolves through rubric-buffer updates rather than parameter updates.

Rubric bank and two modes of adaptation. Each bank item retrospectively distills a completed trajectory into reflection rubrics and
takeaways, summarizing what mattered after one trial. Unlike the prospective rubrics generated during planning, bank items encode
outcome-aware lessons. An example is shown in Fig. 2. They support two adaptation modes: within-episode refinement, which retrieves a
query’s own prior reflection on a repeated attempt, and cross-episode transfer, which retrieves reflections from related past questions.
During training, we realize both modes with a two-encounter curriculum: each query is first solved with cross-episode retrieval and later
replayed with its newly generated within-episode reflection, requiring no extra rollout dependencies.

Efficient asynchronous execution. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4, a synchronous implementation would block the next task rollout
until reflection generation, reflection judging, and the meta-policy update for the current step are finished. We instead allow the
reflection branch to lag by one RL step. During step NN, the inference engine runs the heavy tool-augmented task rollouts, while the training
engine consumes the prepared reflection batch from step N−1N-1 for the meta-policy update. After the step-NN trajectories are judged, their
reflection rollout and judging jobs are launched asynchronously to prepare the reflection batch for step N+1N+1. This one-step staleness
trades exact synchrony for higher infrastructure utilization: both inference and training engines remain occupied, and meta-policy training
adds effectively no extra wall-clock overhead to the SS-GRPO loop. The detailed descriptions are in Appen. D.

4.1 Experimental Setup

We evaluate RubricEM on four representative long-form benchmarks: HealthBench (arora2025healthbench), ResearchQA (yifei2025researchqa),
DeepResearchBench (DRB) (du2025deepresearch), and ResearchRubrics (sharma2026researchrubrics). Our experimental setup is built upon DR Tulu,
where we generally share the same base infrastructure, training datasets, hyperparameters, and evaluation protocols. We use
Gemini-flash-grounded Google Search and Semantic Scholar as the search engines. The training data is sampled from diverse public query
sources, including realistic search conversations from SearchArena (miroyan2025search) and research-oriented questions from OpenScholar (asai2024openscholar).
The SFT stage includes both short-form and long-form data, while the RL stage exclusively focuses on long-form queries. Further details on
datasets, training and inference setups, evaluation protocols, and the full baseline list are provided in Appen. F.

4.2 Main Results

Tab. 1 compares RubricEM with the strongest baselines from each category following shao2025dr. We use reported numbers when available, and
reproduce the remaining baselines if possible.

RubricEM achieves strong long-form research performance. RubricEM-8B-RL achieves the highest average score among non-proprietary deep
research systems in our evaluation, reaching 55.5 with an 8B backbone. It surpasses strong open baselines, including DR Tulu-8B-RL, Tongyi
DeepResearch-30B-A3B, and WebThinker-32B-DPO. It also compares favorably with proprietary systems: on the benchmarks where both scores are
available, RubricEM-8B-RL outperforms Perplexity Deep Research on average, and it remains within 4.4 average points of OpenAI Deep Research
while outperforming it on DRB. These results show that our training recipe can produce competitive long-form research behavior at small model
scale.

The RL recipe is both effective and efficient. Starting from the structured SFT checkpoint, RL improves the average score from 49.2 to 55.5,
with gains on all four long-form benchmarks. This gain is not simply inherited from the teacher: although RubricEM-8B-SFT is distilled from
Gemini-3.1-Pro, the final RubricEM-8B-RL model surpasses it on average. Compared with the closest prior RL system, DR Tulu, RubricEM starts
from a stronger SFT checkpoint, reaches a higher final average score, and uses fewer RL steps (1400 vs. 1900). Since the two systems also
differ in teacher model and search backend (RubricEM uses a weaker teacher but a stronger search backend), we conduct controlled ablations in
Sec. 5 to isolate the contribution of our proposed components.


5 Empirical Analysis
--------------------

Refer to caption Figure 5: Ablation studies of our RL training recipes under a 600-step budget. Each proposed component improves performance,
and the full RubricEM recipe performs best.


5.1 RL Training Recipes

We ablate the RL components of RubricEM under a fixed 600-step budget, using the same training configuration and initializing every run from
the same RubricEM-SFT checkpoint. To reduce evaluation cost, all ablation runs are evaluated on the same fixed random 100-example subset of
each benchmark. We compare four recipes: Baseline-RL, standard answer-only GRPO; SS-GRPO, which replaces terminal reward broadcast with
stagewise rubric credit; Meta-Policy, which keeps answer-only GRPO but adds reflection meta-policy training and rubric-bank retrieval; and
RubricEM (Full), which combines SS-GRPO and Meta-Policy. Results are shown in Fig. 5. Under this matched setting, both SS-GRPO and
Meta-Policy improve over Baseline-RL, and the full recipe performs best across benchmarks. This shows that stagewise credit assignment and
reusable-experience learning provide complementary gains under the same training budget and compute.


5.2 Structured Scaffolding and Inference-Time Experience Reuse

We further analyze the structured scaffold and inference-time experience reuse in Fig. 6. For scaffolding, we compare structured and
unstructured SFT checkpoints, then continue both under matched 600-step RL settings. Fig. 6(a) shows that the structured scaffold improves
distillation quality, while Fig. 6(b) shows that it also makes subsequent RL more effective. Without the scaffold, RL gains are small and
unstable for 600 steps, suggesting that rubric-conditioned stages provide useful structure for exploration and credit assignment. We
additionally isolate the prompt-level effect by running Gemini-3.1-Pro with the same search backend under either our scaffold or a standard
ReAct (think & act) prompt. As shown in Fig. 6(c), our scaffold yields higher DRB performance, indicating that the structure itself improves
deep-research behavior before student-side training. We also evaluate whether the learned meta-policy can be further leveraged at inference
time on DRB. Cross-episode reuse retrieves reflections from related past questions, while within-episode reuse retrieves the agent’s prior
reflection for the same question. As shown in Fig. 6(d), RubricEM benefits from both reuse modes, whereas Baseline-RL does not under the same
retrieval setting. This indicates that Reflection Meta-Policy Training learns actionable, reusable guidance rather than simply increasing the
amount of context provided to the model.

Refer to caption Figure 6: Ablations on structured scaffolding and inference-time experience reuse. Panels (a,b) show that the rubric-guided
scaffold improves both SFT distillation quality and subsequent RL gains. Panel (c) isolates the prompt-level effect: with the same
Gemini-3.1-Pro model and search backend, our scaffold outperforms a standard ReAct prompt on DRB. Panel (d) shows that the learned
meta-policy enables cross-episode transfer and within-episode refinement, while Baseline-RL does not benefit from the same reuse.


5.3 Short-Form Benchmark Performance

In addition to the long-form benchmarks in Tab. 1, we evaluate RubricEM on four short-form search benchmarks: SimpleQA (wei2024measuring),
2Wiki (ho2020constructing), WebWalker (wu2025webwalker), and DeepSearchQA (DSQA) (gupta2026deepsearchqa). These evaluations are out-of-domain
for the RL stage, since online RL uses only long-form prompts. We compare with DR Tulu and report results in Tab. 2. Although RubricEM is
trained primarily for long-form deep research, the result shows strong transfer to short-form search benchmarks. RubricEM-SFT already learns
effective search-and-answer behavior, and long-form RL further improves performance despite using no short-form RL data. The gains are most
pronounced on more complex tasks, suggesting that our RL recipe teaches transferable tool-use and evidence-grounding skills rather than only
long-form report writing. Overall, these results show that a compact 8B model can generalize beyond its long-form training distribution
through effective RL.

Table 2: Short-form Model Performance. Despite being primarily trained on long-form data, RubricEM generalizes well on out-of-distribution
short-form deep research questions.

6 Conclusions
-------------

We presented RubricEM, a rubric-guided RL framework for deep research beyond verifiable rewards. RubricEM structures long-horizon
trajectories, assigns stage-aware credit, and distills judged attempts into reusable guidance through a shared-backbone reflection
meta-policy. Across benchmarks and analyses, RubricEM-8B shows strong performance, with ablations supporting each proposed recipe. Further
discussions and limitations are included in Appen. H.

The Post-training recipes of deep research agents. Deep research agents are increasingly framed as post-trained, tool-interacting policies
rather than merely prompt-engineered retrieval pipelines [zhang2025agenticdeepresearch, li2025rlfoundations, shi2025deepsurvey].
Closed-source systems demonstrate strong long-horizon research capabilities, but their training recipes remain proprietary or only described
at a high level [openai2025deepresearch, google2025geminideepresearch, perplexity2025sonardeepresearch, moonshot2025kimiresearcher]. Most
open training work instead studies search-augmented reasoning as a proxy for deep research, using short-answer or otherwise verifiable tasks
whose rewards come from answer matching, retrieval quality, or rule-based process signals [jin2025searchr1, song2025r1searcher,
chen2025research, jiang2025deepretrieval, zhao2025rsearch, wang2025stepsearch, fan2025ssrl, zhang2025evolvesearch, mei2025o2searcher]. These
methods teach models when and how to retrieve, but leave open how RL should be structured for unverifiable long-form reports.

Recent work has begun to move toward long-horizon deep research agents, focusing on real-web or scalable search training [zheng2025deepresearcher,
wu2025webdancer, li2025websailor, gao2025asearcher], workflow and report-state design [li2025webthinker, qiao2025webresearcher, han2025deep],
and large-scale agentic SFT/RL or RLAIF recipes built largely around verifiable or ground-truth-anchored answer supervision [liu2025webexplorer,
nguyen2025sfrdeepresearch, tongyi2025deepresearch, wan2025pokee]. These works mainly improve the data, environment, workflow, or scale of
deep research agents. Our focus is orthogonal in emphasis: rather than scaling agentic pipelines under verifiable answer supervision, we
study the RL algorithmic structure needed for open-ended long-form research trajectories.

The closest work to ours is DR Tulu, which introduces RLER and establishes the first open end-to-end recipe for training long-form deep
research agents beyond verifiable rewards [shao2025dr]. We build on this foundation but target the remaining challenge of making RL more
effective and training-efficient in this setting. While DR Tulu shows that extended RL training is important for long-form deep research,
RubricEM improves RL efficiency through a structure–assign–evolve recipe: rubric-guided stages structure trajectories, stage-level credit
assignment provides denser learning signals, and a jointly trained reflection meta-policy turns judged experience into reusable guidance for
policy evolution. Empirically, this yields larger gains with fewer RL training steps.

Credit assignment in LLM agentic reinforcement learning.

Credit assignment is a central challenge in agentic RL because sparse outcome rewards make it unclear which intermediate planning, tool-use,
or reasoning decisions should be reinforced. Prior work addresses this issue through process supervision for mathematical reasoning [lightman2023let,
wang2023math], tool- or turn-level reward shaping for interactive agents [qian2025toolrl, li2025encouraging], and more general agentic
credit-assignment mechanisms such as process reward models, implicit step rewards, trajectory-graph advantage assignment, and hierarchical
transition decomposition [xi2026agentprm, liu2026agentic, li2026salt, luo2025agent, peng2026hiper]. These methods show that dense or
process-aware supervision is crucial for long-horizon agent training, but they are typically designed for domains with verifiable
intermediate correctness, structured environment states, tool-specific signals, or learned critics. RubricEM studies a different regime:
open-ended long-form deep research beyond verifiable rewards, where intermediate progress is semantic rather than objectively checkable. We
therefore assign credit at the level of rubric-guided stages, using stage-specific judge scores and causal stage-dependent returns to provide
denser supervision without requiring step labels or a learned critic.

Meta-RL with language models.

Meta-reinforcement learning studies agents that use past experience to adapt future behavior, with classic formulations including recurrent
fast-adaptation policies such as RL2 and Learning to Reinforcement Learn, gradient-based adaptation such as MAML, and latent-context
inference methods such as PEARL [duan2016rl, wang2016learning, finn2017model, rakelly2019efficient]. For LLM agents, this perspective is
natural because trajectories contain rich textual artifacts (plans, tool calls, observations, critiques, and failures) that can be distilled
into reusable guidance. Recent language-agent Meta-RL methods train meta-policies to improve exploration and exploration–exploitation
across repeated tasks [jiang2026metarl, yang2026mage], while MetaClaw studies continual agent evolution through failure-driven skill
synthesis and a reusable skill library [xia2026metaclaw]. However, these works are typically evaluated in verifiable, synthetic, or
task-completion settings, and often rely on explicit support–query or cross-rollout dependencies that are costly for long-horizon web
research. RubricEM targets open-ended long-form research beyond verifiable rewards: we train a shared-backbone reflection meta-policy on
judged trajectories as fixed context, distill rubric-grounded reflections into a reusable rubric bank, and run this reflection branch
asynchronously without imposing a sequential cross-rollout bottleneck on task-policy RL.


Appendix B Details on Structured Scaffolds
------------------------------------------

This section describes the rubric-guided structured scaffold in detail (Section 3.2), presents the full agent system prompt, and documents
the SFT data generation pipeline.


B.1 Scaffold Description and System Prompt

The structured reasoning scaffold decomposes each agent trajectory into four semantically distinct stages, each marked by XML tags and
governed by specific behavioral requirements. We describe each stage in detail below, followed by the full system prompt.

B.1.1 Stage 1: Planning (Plan)

The planning stage is the foundation of the entire trajectory. Upon receiving a user query, the agent must:

  1. 1.

    Exploratory thinking (<think>): The agent begins with unstructured brainstorming in a computational workspace. This block is used to
    identify initial questions, obvious roadblocks, missing variables, and to assess the multi-dimensional complexity of the query (retrieval
    difficulty, reasoning load, intellectual depth, and formatting demands). No structured XML tags are used inside this block.

  2. 2.

    Structured plan (<structured_plan>): The agent then produces a visible, structured planning document containing exactly three
    sub-components:

      * •

        <deep_analysis>: Deconstructs the user’s query into explicit needs (what they directly ask for), implicit needs and gaps (hidden
        constraints, missing variables, potential roadblocks), and a complexity assessment that determines how much effort the agent should
        invest.

      * •

        <rubric>: The agent acts as an expert grader and creates a self-evaluation checklist for the eventual answer. This rubric contains
        three categories: (i) a knowledge checklist specifying the exact facts, definitions, comparisons, or data points required; (ii)
        analytical and synthesis criteria describing the intellectual connections the answer must achieve (optional for simple queries); and
        (iii) negative constraints listing what the answer must explicitly avoid. Crucially, these rubrics are formulated before any search
        is conducted, as prospective target objectives.

      * •

        <research_plan>: A logical roadmap to satisfy the rubric. Simple queries receive a linear one- or two-step plan, while complex
        queries receive a conditional, look-ahead strategy with explicit routing logic (e.g., “If X confirms Y, investigate Z; if X is
        inconclusive, fallback to W”).

  3. 3.

    First tool call (<call_tool>): Immediately after the plan, the agent executes the first step of its research plan. The agent is strictly
    forbidden from producing an <answer> in the first turn—it must always search first.

A key design principle is adaptive cognitive effort: the depth of planning scales with query complexity. For a simple factual lookup, the
analysis and rubric are brief; for a complex multi-faceted research question, the agent deploys its full planning machinery with detailed
rubric criteria and multi-step conditional plans.

B.1.2 Stage 2: Research (Research)

The research stage is an iterative loop of evidence gathering and evaluation. After each tool output, the agent:

  1. 1.

    Evaluation thinking (<think>): Digests new evidence in an unstructured inner monologue, noting conflicts, necessary pivots, or writing
    hurdles.

  2. 2.

    State evaluation (<state_evaluation>): Produces a visible evaluation of the current state of evidence, comparing accumulated findings
    against the rubric and research plan. Based on this evaluation, the agent chooses one of two paths:

      * •

        Path A—Continue research: If more information is needed, the agent either (a) issues another <call_tool> directly if the current
        plan remains valid, or (b) outputs an updated <structured_plan> with revised analysis, rubric, and/or research plan before the next
        tool call. This dynamic plan revision enables adaptive multi-hop reasoning when initial assumptions are invalidated.

      * •

        Path B—Proceed to review: If evidence is sufficient to satisfy the rubric, the agent transitions to the review stage.

The research stage may iterate multiple times. The outer scaffold is sequential (Plan →\rightarrow Research →\rightarrow Review
→\rightarrow Answer), but within Research, the agent can freely iterate between tool use and state evaluation, and can revise its plan in
place.

B.1.3 Stage 3: Review (Review)

Before producing the final answer, the agent must perform a structured self-evaluation. This is not optional—the scaffold enforces it as a
mandatory step. The review block (<review>) contains:

  * •

    <rubric_review>: The agent maps its retrieved evidence back to the specific criteria in its Phase 1 rubric (plus any dynamic updates made
    during research). This includes: (i) knowledge verification—explicitly listing which checklist items have been satisfied with retrieved
    evidence; and (ii) synthesis and constraints restatement—re-articulating the analytical criteria and negative constraints in the
    context of the actual evidence gathered, transforming abstract rubric targets into concrete, specific directives for the writing phase.

  * •

    <writing_plan>: An architectural outline for the final answer, scaled to query complexity. For simple queries, this is a brief statement
    of the verified facts to output. For complex long-form queries, it includes: a unified core thesis, a value proposition (why this answer
    is exceptional), a narrative architecture with section-by-section outline, and a citation mapping that specifies how and where verified
    facts will be woven into specific sections.

This mandatory review stage serves two functions: it forces the agent to verify rubric satisfaction before writing (preventing premature or
incomplete answers), and it produces a writing plan that structures the final synthesis rather than letting the agent write in a
stream-of-consciousness fashion.

B.1.4 Stage 4: Answer (Answer)

The final stage produces the long-form response within <answer>...</answer> tags. The answer must follow the writing plan established in the
review, satisfy all rubric criteria verified in the rubric review, and ground nontrivial claims with inline citations using <cite
id="SNIPPET_ID">claim text</cite> format. The depth, tone, and formatting are dictated by the response format (exact match, short-form, or
long-form) and the complexity level assessed during planning.

B.1.5 Cross-Stage Design Principles

Several design principles span all four stages:

  * •

    Rubric as central anchor. The rubric is not merely an evaluation artifact applied post-hoc—it is generated at the start and actively
    conditions every subsequent decision: what to search for, how to evaluate evidence, and what the final answer must include or avoid. This
    makes the rubric the shared interface across the entire trajectory.

  * •

    One action per turn. Each agent generation must end with exactly one of </call_tool> or </answer>. The agent must stop generating
    immediately after the closing tag. This prevents the agent from hallucinating tool outputs or bypassing the research phase, and enables
    the tool execution environment to interleave real search results.

  * •

    Substance over syntax. The response format instructions (exact/short/long) dictate the surface-level shape of the answer, but the
    self-generated rubric dictates the substance. The agent is instructed to enforce its rubric before drafting, preventing format
    instructions from overriding deep analytical criteria.

B.1.6 Full System Prompt

We present the complete system prompt below. The workflow example section is abbreviated for space.

Full Agent System Prompt

# Role: Elite Autonomous Research & Synthesis Agent

You are an elite agent designed to analyze complex queries,
autonomously perform rubric-guided plans, execute iterative
research, and synthesize highly rigorous, evidence-backed
answers. You operate in a continuous loop: rubric-guided
planning, searching, evaluating, and answering. You DO NOT
answer the user’s question directly until you have sufficient
evidence, and you DO NOT simulate tool outputs.

## CORE PRINCIPLE: ADAPTIVE COGNITIVE EFFORT
Your level of planning rigor, research depth, and synthesis
MUST dynamically scale with the true, multi-dimensional
complexity of the user’s query and the evolving search
landscape.
- Complexity is Multi-Dimensional: It encompasses retrieval
  difficulty, reasoning load, intellectual depth, and
  formatting demands.
- Scale Your Effort: Do not over-engineer simple tasks.
  Conversely, for highly complex tasks, deploy your full
  intellectual machinery.

## EXPECTED RESPONSE FORMATS & SYNTAX RULES
Map your drafting strategy to the requested format appended
to the prompt. ALL final outputs MUST be enclosed within
<answer>...</answer>:

1. Exact Match: Format strictly as \boxed{exact answer}.
2. Short-Form: Write a single, cohesive paragraph with
   <cite id="...">...</cite> support.
3. Long-Form: Write a comprehensive, markdown-structured
   response. Synthesize sources into a cohesive narrative.
   Ground all nontrivial claims with <cite id="...">...</cite>.

CRITICAL: formatting instructions appended to the user’s
prompt dictate the shape of your answer, but your dynamically
updated <rubric> dictates the substance.

---

## PHASE 1: PLANNING & INITIATION

STEP 0: Exploratory Thinking
Begin with a <think> block. Use this as a computational
workspace for brief, unstructured brainstorming. Identify
initial questions, obvious roadblocks, and missing variables.

STEP 1: The Structured Plan
Output a single <structured_plan> block containing exactly
three sections, building upon each other logically:

1. <deep_analysis>: Discover the True Intent.
   - Complexity Assessment: Evaluate the multi-dimensional
     complexity (retrieval, reasoning, insight, formulation).
   - Explicit Needs: What they are directly asking for.
   - Implicit Needs & Gaps: Hidden constraints, missing
     variables, or potential roadblocks.

2. <rubric>: Define the Strict Grading Criteria. Act as an
   expert grader creating a rigorous checklist. Draw upon the
   <deep_analysis> as a foundation. DO NOT focus on formatting;
   focus on required content, intellectual depth, and logical
   constraints.
   - Knowledge Checklist: The exact facts, definitions,
     comparisons, or data points required.
   - Analytical & Synthesis Criteria (Optional, for complex
     queries): What intellectual connections must the response
     achieve?
   - Negative Constraints (Pitfalls): What must the response
     explicitly AVOID?

3. <research_plan>: Formulate the Strategy. Create a logical
   roadmap to satisfy the rubric. Simple queries need a linear
   step or two; complex queries require a conditional,
   look-ahead strategy.

STEP 2: The First Tool Call
Immediately after closing </structured_plan>, execute ONLY
the first step of your research plan. Under NO circumstances
should you output an <answer> in this first turn.

---

## PHASE 2: SEARCH & SYNTHESIS

STEP 0: Evaluation Thinking
Begin with a <think> block for raw inner monologue to digest
new evidence.

STEP 1: State Evaluation & Action
Output a <state_evaluation> block to analyze the tool output,
then choose exactly ONE path:

PATH A: Continue Research (More Information Needed)
- Direct Search: If the current plan and rubric are still
  valid, output your next <call_tool>.

    long-form response within <answer>...</answer> tags.”


B.2 SFT Data Generation Process

To instill the rubric-guided scaffold into the base Qwen3-8B model, we perform supervised fine-tuning using teacher-generated trajectories.
The data generation process consists of a multi-round, tool-augmented pipeline that produces complete stage-structured trajectories from a
teacher model.

B.2.1 Teacher Model and Prompt Adaptation

We use Gemini-3.1-Pro as the teacher model. The training queries are drawn from the same dataset used by Dr. Tulu [shao2025dr], which
contains ∼{\sim}13K diverse, open-ended research questions spanning multiple domains. Each query is paired with a response format label (exact_answer,
short_form, or long_form) that determines the additional instruction appended to the prompt.

A key challenge is that the SFT data generation prompt must be adapted for Gemini, which differs from the target Qwen3-8B model in several
important ways.

Reasoning traces and <scratchpad>.

Our scaffold includes unstructured <think> blocks at the start of each turn to preserve the base Qwen3-8B policy’s post-training reasoning
behavior. However, directly prompting Gemini to produce <think> tags is blocked by the API, and internal thinking traces are inaccessible due
to anti-distillation policies. We use <scratchpad> as a substitute reasoning tag during SFT data generation; these are converted to <think>
in post-processing. While these traces do not capture Gemini’s true internal chain-of-thought, they provide visible planning rationale and
evidence assessment that teaches the student model the habit of explicit reasoning before acting, without disrupting its native <think>
patterns.

Stagewise prompt separation.

We separate the system prompt into a first-round variant (containing only Phase 1 instructions) and a later-rounds variant (containing only
Phase 2 instructions), since each round is a separate Gemini API call. This separation serves two purposes: it keeps each prompt focused on
the current stage’s requirements (reducing prompt length and improving adherence), and it ensures the model invests heavily in planning at
step 1 (generating the full <structured_plan> with analysis, rubric, and research plan) rather than skipping ahead to search or answering
directly. Each variant explicitly constrains the turn-ending tag: the first round must end with </call_tool>, and later rounds must end with
either </call_tool> or </answer>.

We present the core of each generation prompt below (omitting tool documentation and workflow examples, which mirror the final agent prompt).

SFT Generation Prompt: First Round (Phase 1 Only)

# Role: Elite Research Planning & Initiation Agent

You are an elite Research Planning Agent. Your purpose is to
analyze complex queries, generate a rigorous, visible research
plan, and initiate the very first search query to kick off the
research process. You DO NOT answer the user’s question
directly, and you DO NOT simulate tool outputs.

## CORE PRINCIPLE: ADAPTIVE COGNITIVE EFFORT
[... same as final prompt ...]

## Process

STEP 0: Exploratory Scratchpad
Begin with a <scratchpad> block. This is your mandatory
computational workspace. Use this space for a brief,
unstructured exploration of the user’s query --- identify
initial hurdles and missing variables before moving to
structured output. Do not output XML tags inside scratchpad.

STEP 1: The Structured Plan
Output a single <structured_plan> block containing exactly
three sections, building upon each other logically:

1. <deep_analysis>: Discover the True Intent.
   - Complexity Assessment: Evaluate the multi-dimensional
     complexity (retrieval, reasoning, insight, formulation).
   - Explicit Needs: What they are directly asking for
     (including structural/formatting instructions).
   - Implicit Needs & Gaps: Hidden constraints, missing
     variables, or potential roadblocks.

2. <rubric>: Define the Strict Grading Criteria. Act as an
   expert grader creating a rigorous checklist. DO NOT focus
   on formatting; focus on content, depth, and constraints.
   - Knowledge Checklist: Exact facts, definitions, data
     points required (e.g., "The response explicitly defines
     the von Neumann bottleneck").
   - Analytical & Synthesis Criteria (Optional, for complex
     queries): What intellectual connections must the response
     achieve?
   - Negative Constraints (Pitfalls): What must the response
     explicitly AVOID? (e.g., "The response avoids presenting
     industry blogs as academic consensus").

3. <research_plan>: Formulate the Strategy. Create a logical
   roadmap to satisfy the rubric. Simple queries: linear
   steps. Complex queries: conditional, look-ahead strategy
   (e.g., "Step 1: Find X. Step 2: If X confirms Y,
   investigate Z; if inconclusive, fallback to W").

STEP 2: The First Tool Call
Immediately after closing </structured_plan>, execute ONLY
the first step of your <research_plan>. Once you output
</call_tool>, you must STOP generating text.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS
- Output MUST begin with <scratchpad>, then <structured_plan>.
- Execute EXACTLY ONE tool call.
- DO NOT simulate <tool_output>.
- DO NOT attempt to write the final <answer>.

[... tool documentation and workflow examples omitted ...]

SFT Generation Prompt: Later Rounds (Phase 2 Only)

# Role: Elite Iterative Research & Synthesis Agent

You are in the active research phase. You have already
generated an initial Rubric and Research Plan. Your goal is to
evaluate the latest retrieved information, dynamically adjust
your strategy if necessary, and either continue searching or
generate the final answer.

## CONTEXT: THE PHASE 1 FOUNDATION
Prior to your current phase, an initial <structured_plan> was
generated. This plan is your foundational blueprint consisting
of <deep_analysis>, <rubric>, and <research_plan>. You must
constantly evaluate incoming evidence against this baseline.

## Process & Decision Tree

STEP 0: Evaluation Scratchpad
Begin with a <scratchpad> block. This is your mandatory
computational workspace for raw, unstructured inner monologue
to digest newly retrieved evidence. If data contradicts
assumptions, briefly identify the conflict and note your
pivot. If evidence is sufficient for a complex query, pinpoint
writing hurdles before resolving them in <review>.

STEP 1: State Evaluation & Action
Output a <state_evaluation> block to formally analyze the
latest tool output, then choose exactly ONE path:

PATH A: Continue Research (More Information Needed)
- Direct Search: If the current plan and rubric are still
  valid, output your next <call_tool> immediately.
- Update & Search: If new information invalidates initial
  assumptions, triggers a fallback, or reveals a deeper
  multi-hop requirement:
  1. Output an updated <structured_plan> with revised
     <deep_analysis>, <rubric>, and/or <research_plan>.
     (Only include sections that require updates.)
  2. Then output your next <call_tool>.

PATH B: Ready to Answer (Evidence Sufficient)
1. The Review: Output a <review> block containing:
   - <rubric_review>: Systematically map retrieved evidence
     back to the Phase 1 <rubric> (plus any dynamic updates).
     * Knowledge Verification: List the critical facts and
       data points that satisfy the Knowledge Checklist.
     * Synthesis & Constraints Restatement: Re-articulate
       Analytical Criteria and Negative Constraints in the
       context of retrieved evidence. Transform abstract
       rubric targets into concrete directives for drafting.
   - <writing_plan>: Outline the final answer architecture,
     scaling effort to query complexity:
     * Low-Complexity: State verified facts directly.
     * High-Complexity: Define (1) unified core thesis,
       (2) value proposition, (3) narrative architecture
       with section-by-section outline, (4) citation mapping
       specifying how verified facts integrate into sections.
2. The Final Answer: Output within <answer>...</answer> tags.
   Depth and formatting MUST match the writing plan. Follow
   the Knowledge Checklist and honor all constraints from
   the <rubric_review>.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS
- Output MUST begin with <scratchpad>, then <state_evaluation>.
- One Action Per Turn: end with </call_tool> OR </answer>.
  STOP generating immediately after the closing tag.
- Mandatory Citations: wrap claims in
  <cite id="S_123">claim text</cite>. Never use empty tags.
- Substance over Syntax: formatting instructions dictate
  shape; the <rubric> dictates substance. Enforce the rubric
  before drafting.

[... tool documentation and workflow examples omitted ...]

The key difference from the unified final agent prompt is the strict separation of responsibilities: the first-round prompt forbids answering
and requires a full planning phase, while the later-rounds prompt assumes the plan already exists and focuses on evidence evaluation and
synthesis. This separation ensures the teacher invests in thorough planning rather than short-circuiting to an answer.

Common failure modes.

Despite these adaptations, Gemini-3.1-Pro frequently violates the scaffold constraints. Common failures include answering directly from
internal knowledge without searching, producing output that does not end with the required closing tag, omitting required structural elements
such as <rubric> or <state_evaluation>, and generating variant tool names that do not match the expected schema. These violations necessitate
aggressive rejection sampling (described below).

B.2.2 Multi-Round Generation Pipeline

Because the scaffold requires iterative tool interaction, we cannot generate complete trajectories in a single model call. Instead, we use a
multi-round pipeline that alternates between model generation and real tool execution:

  1. 1.

    Round 1 (Initiation): The teacher receives the first-round system prompt and user query. It generates Phase 1 output: <scratchpad>,
    <structured_plan> (with <deep_analysis>, <rubric>, <research_plan>), and the first <call_tool>. Generation stops at the closing
    </call_tool> tag.

  2. 2.

    Tool routing and execution: Each <call_tool> is parsed to extract the tool name and query. The pipeline routes calls to one of two
    backends:

      * •

        google_search: Submitted as Vertex AI batch prediction jobs using Gemini with Google Search grounding enabled, which returns
        AI-synthesized summaries with grounding snippets.

      * •

        snippet_search: Executed asynchronously against the Semantic Scholar API, which returns paper excerpts matching the query.

    Both backends run in parallel to maximize throughput. Responses where the tool fails to call a valid tool (e.g., answering from internal
    knowledge) are separated into an error stream for potential reprocessing.

  3. 3.

    Rounds 2–NN (Research iteration): The tool output is appended to the conversation history, and the teacher receives the later-rounds
    system prompt. It generates the next Phase 2 turn: <scratchpad>, <state_evaluation>, and either another <call_tool> or the <review> and
    <answer>. This loop continues until the teacher produces a closing </answer> tag or a maximum of 10 rounds is reached.

  4. 4.

    Completion detection: A trajectory is considered complete when the teacher’s output ends with </answer>. Incomplete trajectories that
    exhaust the maximum rounds are discarded. Because Gemini often fails to produce a well-formed closing tag, a substantial fraction of
    trajectories (∼{\sim}15–25%) are discarded at this stage.

B.2.3 Quality Filtering and Rejection Sampling

Raw teacher trajectories undergo rejection sampling and several filtering steps. This is critical because Gemini-3.1-Pro, despite being a
strong model, frequently violates the scaffold’s structural constraints when generating multi-round tool-augmented trajectories.

Rejection criteria.

The following trajectories are rejected:

  * •

    Missing </answer> tag (hard reject): The most common failure mode. The teacher generates extensive content but never produces the closing
    </answer> tag, either because it runs out of tokens, enters an endless research loop, or simply stops mid-sentence. These trajectories
    are discarded entirely.

  * •

    No valid tool call in non-final rounds: Each non-final round must end with a valid </call_tool> tag containing a parseable tool name and
    query. Trajectories where the model skips tool use and attempts to answer from internal knowledge (e.g., producing a long response
    without any <call_tool>) are rejected. This is the second most common failure mode, particularly on simple factual queries where Gemini
    “knows” the answer and refuses to search.

  * •

    Missing structural elements: Trajectories must contain valid <structured_plan> (with <deep_analysis> and <rubric>) in the first round,
    and <state_evaluation> in subsequent rounds. Those with malformed XML or missing required sections are discarded.

  * •

    Consecutive tool errors: Trajectories with two or more consecutive rounds where the tool backend returned an error (e.g., search blocked
    by safety filters, API rate limits, “no grounding data available”) are discarded. Single error rounds followed by successful recovery
    are retained, as these teach the model error-resilient behavior.

Post-processing transformations.

Accepted trajectories undergo the following conversions:

  * •

    Reasoning tag conversion: All <scratchpad>...</scratchpad> tags from Gemini’s output are converted to <think>...</think> for
    compatibility with Qwen3’s chat template, which uses <think> as the native reasoning tag.

  * •

    Tool name normalization: Gemini occasionally produces variant tool names (e.g., google_web_search, Scholar_Search) or malformed attribute
    strings. These are normalized to the canonical google_search and snippet_search names.

B.2.4 Training Data Format

Each filtered trajectory is converted into a single-turn ChatML conversation with three messages:

  * •

    System: The full agent system prompt (the unified Qwen3 version from Sec. B.1, not the Gemini-adapted generation prompt).

  * •

    User: The original query with the format-specific additional instruction appended.

  * •

    Assistant: The complete multi-round trajectory, with tool outputs wrapped in special span-masking markers. Only the model-generated
    tokens (thinking, planning, tool calls, state evaluation, review, and answer) receive gradient during training; tool output tokens are
    masked so the model does not learn to memorize search results.

Finally, this process yields around 11k SFT samples, approximately 2k fewer than DR Tulu due to the repeated errors described above, which
are filtered out.


Appendix C Details on Stagewise Evolving Rubric Evaluation
----------------------------------------------------------

This section provides implementation details for the stagewise evolving rubric design described in Section 3.3. The judge operates in two
phases: adaptive rubric generation proposes new rubrics by comparing trajectories for the same question, and stagewise scoring evaluates each
trajectory against the current rubric set. Both phases use an LLM judge (Gemini-3-Flash) with structured JSON output.


C.1 Rubric Buffer

For each training question, we maintain a rubric buffer with two types of rubrics: persistent rubrics (static, ground-truth rubrics from the
training data, never removed) and active rubrics (adaptive rubrics proposed online by the judge, organized by stage and subject to per-stage
capacity caps). The persistent rubrics are adapted from shao2025dr and only used for the final answer stage. At each training step, for each
unique question in the batch, the judge (i) generates new adaptive rubrics by comparing the rollout group, (ii) adds them to the buffer,
(iii) scores all trajectories against the combined rubric set, and (iv) removes low-discrimination rubrics that did not meaningfully separate
trajectory quality.


C.2 Adaptive Rubric Generation

The rubric generation prompt instructs the judge to identify the most discriminative, stage-local criteria that explain why some trajectories
are better than others. Several design principles considered:

  * •

    Discriminative and specific: Each rubric must actually separate stronger from weaker trajectories for the same question. Descriptions
    must reference concrete aspects of the question so a separate scorer can unambiguously judge them. Vague rubrics like “good research
    quality” are prohibited.

  * •

    Stage-local and non-redundant: Rubrics target each stage’s specific responsibility. The judge avoids creating positive and negative
    mirror versions of the same criterion, and skips criteria already covered by existing rubrics.

  * •

    Anti-hack: The judge must not create rubrics that merely check XML tag existence, reward formal obedience to a weak plan, overfit to one
    trajectory’s wording, or confuse self-consistency with true quality.

A key feature enabled by our rubric-guided scaffold is that the judge can use the agent’s own <rubric> blocks from different trajectories
as references when proposing adaptive rubrics—strong rubrics across trajectories can reveal important task dimensions and failure modes.
However, a trajectory’s own rubric is never the scoring standard: the judge is instructed to never reward following a weak self-rubric or
penalize evidence-based improvement beyond the original plan.

Rather than prescribing fixed templates, the prompt provides stage-specific guidance as starting points. For each stage, a central question
frames the evaluation: “Did the agent understand the problem?” (Plan), “Did it search effectively and adapt?” (Research), “Did it
honestly audit readiness?” (Review), and “Is the final answer high-quality?” (Answer). Common useful dimensions are suggested (e.g.,
query specificity, evidence-based pivoting for Research), but the judge is encouraged to discover what matters for each specific question.

Each rubric item contains a title, description, and weight (1=minor, 2=important, 3=critical), organized into positive and negative rubrics
per stage. Target counts are 1–4 rubrics per stage for stages 1–3 and 2–5 for stage 4, treated as targets rather than quotas. The full
rubric generation prompt is shown below:

Stagewise Adaptive Rubric Generation Prompt (Core)

You are an expert evaluator generating stagewise comparative
rubrics for multiple full trajectories produced by the SAME
research agent on the SAME question.

## Goal
Identify the most discriminative, stage-local criteria that
explain why some trajectories are better than others. Evaluate
real process quality and answer quality — not XML compliance,
verbosity, or shallow self-consistency.

## How to Read the Trajectories
Each trajectory is a structured full execution trace:
- Stage 1 — Plan: <structured_plan> with <deep_analysis>,
  <rubric>, <research_plan>
- Stage 2 — Research: iterative <state_evaluation>, tool
  calls, and possible plan/rubric updates
- Stage 3 — Review: <review> with <rubric_review> and
  <writing_plan>
- Stage 4 — Answer: final <answer>

Do not reward a stage just because the relevant tags exist.
Judge whether that stage actually performs its intended
function well.

## How to Use Agent-Generated Rubrics
A trajectory’s own Stage 1 <rubric> is never the scoring
standard. Use it only as a reference signal:
- it shows what the agent recognized as important,
- it may surface useful task dimensions,
- it may expose shallow planning if it misses critical needs.
But: never reward following a weak self-rubric, never let a
narrow self-rubric lower the real standard, never penalize
evidence-based improvement beyond the original plan.

## Stage-by-Stage Guidance
For each stage, the most discriminative criteria often emerge
from the specific question and trajectories themselves. The
dimensions below are common starting points:

Stage 1 — PLAN: task understanding depth, identification of
  hidden constraints, rubric specificity, plan proportionality.
Stage 2 — RESEARCH: query specificity, evidence-based
  pivoting, triangulation, stopping criteria.
Stage 3 — REVIEW: honest gap assessment, evidence-to-
  structure mapping, drafting plan quality.
Stage 4 — ANSWER: readability, instruction following,
  insightfulness, comprehensiveness, correctness, evidence
  grounding. Evaluated independently from earlier trajectory.

## Anti-Hack Rules
Do NOT create rubrics that: only check tag existence, reward
formal obedience to a bad plan, overfit to one trajectory’s
wording, confuse self-consistency with true quality, punish
evidence-based improvement, or reward unnecessary overhead.

## Selection Rules
- Fewer, sharper rubrics over many generic ones.
- Skip criteria where all trajectories perform similarly.
- Never create positive and negative mirrors of the same idea.
- Conservative negative rubrics: target clear failure modes.

## Output Format
Return rubrics by stage (stage_1 through stage_4), each with
positive_rubrics and negative_rubrics. Each item: title,
description, weight (1-3).


C.3 Stagewise Scoring

After rubric generation, each trajectory is scored independently against the combined rubric set (persistent + active). Positive rubrics use
a 0/1/2 scale (absent / partial / full), and negative rubrics use the same scale but inverted during aggregation: a score of 0 (no flaw)
contributes positively. Each evaluation includes a brief justification grounded in specific trajectory evidence. For each stage kk, the
per-stage score Ri,k∈[0,1]R_{i,k}\in[0,1] is a weighted average of rubric scores within that stage, with negative scores inverted before
aggregation.

Stagewise Scoring Prompt

You are an expert evaluator. You will receive an AI research
agent’s full trajectory and a set of rubrics grouped by stage.
Score each rubric strictly based on the trajectory evidence.

## Trajectory Structure
- Stage 1 (Plan): start through end of </structured_plan>
- Stage 2 (Research): after </structured_plan> through all
  tool-call loops
- Stage 3 (Review): last <think> before <review> through
  </review>
- Stage 4 (Answer): <answer> through end of text

## Scoring Rules
[POSITIVE] rubrics:
  2 = FULLY exhibits this quality
  1 = PARTIALLY exhibits it
  0 = Completely ABSENT or fails

[NEGATIVE] rubrics:
  2 = Fully EXHIBITS the flaw
  1 = PARTIALLY exhibits the flaw
  0 = Successfully AVOIDS the flaw

## Instructions
- Score each rubric independently.
- Use the rubric description as the sole scoring criterion.
- Provide brief justification grounded in specific trajectory
  evidence (quote or reference concrete content).
- Return the exact rubric index with each score.


C.4 Buffer Management and Implementation

Buffer dynamics.

Each stage maintains a capacity cap on active rubrics (3, 2, 2, 3 for stages 1–4 in our experiments). When a stage exceeds its cap after
scoring, rubrics with the lowest discrimination (measured by score variance across the rollout group) are removed. Persistent rubrics are
never removed. When a question reappears in a later training step, new adaptive rubrics from the improved policy are added, potentially
replacing stale ones that no longer discriminate. This ensures the judge’s criteria co-evolve with the policy, consistent with the evolving
rubric paradigm of shao2025dr, extended here from answer-only to stagewise evaluation.

Structured JSON output.

Both rubric generation and scoring use Gemini’s structured output mode (response_mime_type="application/json") with Pydantic-derived JSON
schemas. This guarantees schema compliance (rubrics organized by stage with title/description/weight, scores with indices and justifications)
without fragile post-hoc text parsing.

Batch parallelism.

At each training step, the batch contains 32 unique questions ×\times 8 rollouts = 256 trajectories. All 32 rubric generation calls are
launched concurrently via asyncio.gather, followed by all 256 scoring calls in parallel. Each call includes exponential-backoff retry logic
(up to 5 retries). Failed calls are treated as “no new rubrics” (generation) or fall back to terminal answer score only (scoring).

Efficiency.

Rubric generation requires only 32 calls per step (one per question, not per trajectory). Scoring requires 256 calls but each is lightweight
(∼{\sim}8–15 rubrics per trajectory). The combined rubric generation + scoring phase takes approximately 5 minutes per step, overlapping
with the training engine’s gradient computation. The judge model (Gemini-3-Flash) is chosen for cost and latency; the structured output
constraint and detailed prompt compensate for the smaller model’s limitations.


Appendix D Asynchronous Reflection Pipeline and Windowed Curriculum
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This appendix provides the implementation details for the meta-policy training pipeline and the windowed retrieval curriculum described in
Section 3.4.


D.1 Training Pipeline Architecture

Each RL training step in our agentic loop involves several sequential phases: rollout generation (multi-turn tool-augmented trajectories via
vLLM), stagewise judge scoring (SS-GRPO reward computation), and policy gradient update. Reflection generation (prompting the backbone to
produce rubric-grounded reflections from sampled trajectories) introduces an additional compute requirement that we overlap with the main
loop.

Our pipeline uses three concurrent threads:

  1. 1.

    Main thread (training engine): Performs gradient updates on the policy. Alternates between Phase A (meta-policy update on deferred
    reflections from the previous step) and Phase B (task-policy SS-GRPO update on the current step’s rollouts).

  2. 2.

    Inference thread (vLLM): Generates multi-turn tool-augmented rollouts. During Phase A, the inference engine begins generating the next
    batch of rollouts while the training engine trains on deferred reflections—fully overlapping inference and reflection training.

  3. 3.

    Data preparation thread: Runs judge scoring (async Gemini API calls), launches reflection generation and reflection judging as concurrent
    background tasks, and prepares packed training batches. Reward scoring results are returned immediately for task-policy training;
    reflection scoring continues asynchronously.


D.2 One-Step Deferred Reflection Training

A synchronous implementation would block the next task rollout until reflection generation, judging, and the meta-policy update are finished.
We instead defer reflection training by one RL step, as illustrated in the bottom panel of Fig. 4.

At step NN:

  1. 1.

    The inference engine generates task rollouts for step NN.

  2. 2.

    The data preparation thread scores step NN rollouts (SS-GRPO rewards) and simultaneously launches background tasks for: (a) reflection
    rollout generation via vLLM, producing nn candidates per sampled trajectory, and (b) judge scoring of the reflection candidates.

  3. 3.

    Reward results are returned immediately; the training engine performs the SS-GRPO task-policy update on step NN.

  4. 4.

    Meanwhile, reflection scoring completes in the background. Accepted reflections are inserted into the rubric bank, and the scored
    reflection samples are placed in a deferred buffer.

  5. 5.

    At the start of step N+1N{+}1, during Phase A, the training engine trains on the deferred reflection buffer from step NN while the
    inference engine generates step N+1N{+}1 rollouts.

This one-step staleness trades exact synchrony for higher infrastructure utilization: both inference and training engines remain continuously
occupied, and meta-policy training adds effectively no extra wall-clock overhead to the SS-GRPO loop.


D.3 Windowed Curriculum

Since reflection training is deferred by one step and bank insertion happens asynchronously, a naïve curriculum that immediately revisits a
query after its first encounter may attempt within-episode retrieval before the corresponding reflection has been generated and accepted. To
avoid this conflict, we introduce a windowed curriculum with window size KK that provides sufficient temporal separation between a query’s
first and second encounters.

Training alternates between two phases within each window of 2​K2K steps:

  1. 1.

    New-query phase (steps 1,…,K1,\ldots,K within the window): The dataloader samples KK fresh query batches
    {B1,B2,…,BK}\{B_{1},B_{2},\ldots,B_{K}\}. For each batch, the bank performs cross-episode retrieval: semantically similar items from
    past (different) queries are injected as few-shot exemplars. At the end of each step, reflection generation is launched asynchronously in
    the background.

  2. 2.

    Repeat phase (steps K+1,…,2​KK{+}1,\ldots,2K within the window): The same batches are replayed in order:
    B1,B2,…,BKB_{1},B_{2},\ldots,B_{K}. For each batch, the bank performs within-episode retrieval: the exact reflection generated during
    the new-query phase is retrieved and injected as direct self-guidance.

The KK-step gap between a query’s first encounter and its repeat guarantees that the deferred reflection pipeline (generation, judging,
bank insertion, and at least one deferred training step) has fully completed before within-episode retrieval is attempted. In our
experiments, we use K=3K{=}3, providing a comfortable margin over the one-step deferral.

Figure 7: Windowed curriculum with K=3K{=}3. Each window of 2​K=62K{=}6 steps alternates between new queries with cross-episode retrieval
and repeated queries with within-episode exact retrieval. The 3-step gap ensures the deferred reflection pipeline has fully completed before
the repeat.


D.4 Trajectory Sampling and Candidate Generation

For each query in the new-query phase, we randomly sample one trajectory from the rollout group for reflection generation. The sampling is
uniform random over trajectory indices, without length bias or score-based selection, mirroring inference conditions where the agent does not
have access to privileged scoring information. From the sampled trajectory, we generate n=8n{=}8 reflection candidates via vLLM parallel
sampling (temperature 0.70.7, single prompt, nn completions). Each candidate is independently scored by the judge, and only the
highest-scored candidate with valid output format is accepted into the bank. Each query’s reflection generation is independent, so a
failure for one query does not affect others.


D.5 Bank Persistence and Retrieval

The rubric bank maintains an in-memory FAISS index over query embeddings (computed via Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B on CPU). For cross-episode
retrieval, the query embedding is compared against stored embeddings via inner-product similarity, and the top-kk items (default: k=2k{=}2)
are returned. For within-episode retrieval, items are matched by exact question hash (SHA-256). When a query already has a bank item and the
same query is encountered in a later training step, the new reflection overwrites the old one, keeping the bank synchronized with the
evolving policy.

The bank is persisted every 10 steps and at every model checkpoint, using atomic writes (write to temp file, then rename) to prevent
corruption. On training resume, the bank is restored from the checkpoint corresponding to the same global step as the model weights, ensuring
consistency between the policy parameters and the memory contents.


D.6 Prompt Templates

D.6.1 Reflection Generation Prompt

The policy model receives the following system prompt when generating rubric-grounded reflections:

Reflection System Prompt

You are a strict postmortem editor for long-form
deep research QA.

You will receive:
- a question
- a research trajectory ending in a final
  <answer>...</answer>

Your job is not to answer the question again. Your
job is to extract the most useful guidance for:
1. a stronger next attempt on this question, and
2. similar long-form research questions.

First, read the final <answer>.
Judge it on: correctness and calibration;
instruction-following and coverage; research quality
and verification; synthesis and insight;
communication and structure.

Then identify the 2-4 highest-leverage strengths or
weaknesses, trace them back to the visible trajectory,
and turn them into reusable guidance.

Rules:
- Stay grounded in the provided question and
  trajectory.
- Do not invent flaws just to be critical.
- Do not speculate about hidden reasoning not shown
  in the trajectory.
- Do not rewrite the answer.
- Do not give generic advice like "be more careful."
- Write specific guidance that is grounded in this
  case but transferable to similar questions.

Output format (exactly two blocks):

<reflection_rubrics>
Critical Requirement / Analytical Approach
/ Communication & Structure / Pitfalls
</reflection_rubrics>

<reflection_takeaways>
1-4 concise portable lessons
</reflection_takeaways>

The user message provides the question and the full research trajectory, instructing the model to examine the final answer, trace strengths
and weaknesses, and produce both output blocks.

D.6.2 Judge Scoring Prompt

An LLM judge (Gemini) evaluates each reflection candidate with privileged access to the graded trajectory, including per-rubric scores and
evaluator justifications. The judge scores each candidate on how useful it would be for future attempts:

Reflection Judge System Prompt (abridged)

You are an expert judge evaluating reflection
candidates produced by a research agent.

Scoring Dimensions (each 0.0 to 1.0):

Diagnostic Accuracy (weight 0.4)
- Does it correctly identify the main strengths and
  weaknesses? Is it aligned with the evaluator
  justifications and visible trajectory?
  Penalize: missing a major failure clearly flagged
  by the evaluator; inventing problems not supported
  by the trajectory; misidentifying root causes.

Specificity (weight 0.3)
- Is the guidance concrete, actionable, and tailored
  for next attempt of the question?
  Penalize: generic advice ("be more thorough");
  checklist items that could apply to any task;
  merely restating evaluator language.

Scope & Balance (weight 0.3)
- Is the guidance helpful for other questions?
  Are takeaways complementary?
  Penalize: missing an important category; repeating
  the same point across sections.

Rules:
- Score based on the reflection’s quality as future
  guidance, not on the trajectory’s quality.
- A reflection on a perfect trajectory can score low
  if it is generic.
- A reflection on a failed trajectory can score high
  if it precisely identifies root causes.

The user message provides the original question, all reflection candidates, and the graded trajectory with evaluator feedback. The judge
returns per-candidate scores across all three dimensions.

D.6.3 Injection Formats

Retrieved bank items are injected as a <reference_examples> block appended to the user message before tokenization. The two retrieval modes
from Section 3.4—within-episode refinement and cross-episode transfer—use distinct preambles to condition the agent’s use of the
retrieved guidance.

Within-episode injection.

When the agent revisits a question it has attempted before (repeat phase of the windowed curriculum), the accepted reflection from the
previous encounter is injected:

Within-Episode Injection Format

<reference_examples>
You have attempted this exact question before. Below
are the rubrics and reflections from your previous
attempt. Use them to improve your planning and
answering -- avoid past mistakes and build on what
worked.

## Your Previous Attempt on This Question:

### Rubrics:
{rubrics from bank item}

### Takeaways:
{reflections from bank item}
</reference_examples>

{Original user question}

Cross-episode injection.

For a new query (new-query phase), the bank retrieves the top-kk semantically similar items and presents them as rubric-grounded exemplars:

Cross-Episode Injection Format

<reference_examples>
Below are rubrics and reflections from similar
questions that were previously analyzed. Use them as
reference to guide your planning and answering --
adapt to the current question’s specific needs.
Do NOT copy them verbatim; extract what is relevant
and adjust.

## Similar Question 1:
{question from bank item 1}

### Rubrics:
{rubrics from bank item 1}

### Takeaways:
{reflections from bank item 1}

---

## Similar Question 2:
{question from bank item 2}

### Rubrics:
{rubrics from bank item 2}

### Takeaways:
{reflections from bank item 2}
</reference_examples>

{Original user question}

In both cases, the reference block precedes the original user question, so the agent sees the guidance before beginning its structured plan.
The within-episode format signals direct self-improvement (“avoid past mistakes”), while the cross-episode format signals analogical
transfer (“adapt to the current question’s specific needs”).


Appendix E Theoretical Analysis
-------------------------------


E.1 Value of Stage Information

In the main text, Theorem 1 is stated using the informal notation h,c,zh,c,z inside conditional expectations for readability. In this
appendix, we make the probability space explicit: H,C,ZH,C,Z denote random variables, while h,c,zh,c,z denote realized values. We also
slightly sharpen the strictness condition in the theorem by requiring the compared stages to have positive conditional probability given cc;
without this requirement, the pointwise quantities 𝔼​[U​(H,a)∣C=c,Z=z]\mathbb{E}[U(H,a)\mid C=c,Z=z] on impossible stage events are
version-dependent.

The result below is a value-of-information statement specialized to structured agent reasoning. It compares two information structures,
σ​(C)\sigma(C) and σ​(C,Z)\sigma(C,Z). Unlike full state-abstraction theorems, it does not assume that (C,Z)(C,Z) is sufficient for the
entire history HH; it only quantifies the gain from making the stage label explicit under a compressed decision state.

Assumption 1 (Setup for Theorem 1).

Throughout this subsection, the following assumptions hold.

  1. 1.

    Underlying probability space. There exists a probability space (Ω,ℱ,ℙ)(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}) and a random decision history

    H:Ω→ℋ,H:\Omega\to\mathcal{H},

    where (ℋ,ℬ​(ℋ))(\mathcal{H},\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})) is a measurable space. The law of HH is denoted by
    d:=ℙ∘H−1d:=\mathbb{P}\circ H^{-1}. We interpret HH as a random reachable decision point sampled from some fixed distribution over
    histories.

  2. 2.

    Finite action space. The action space 𝒜\mathcal{A} is a finite nonempty set. Consequently, every maximization and argmax over
    𝒜\mathcal{A} is well-defined and nonempty.

  3. 3.

    Compressed context and stage label. There exists a measurable map

    ϕ:ℋ→𝒞\phi:\mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{C}

    into a standard Borel space (𝒞,ℬ​(𝒞))(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{C})), and a measurable stage map

    ψ:ℋ→[K]:={1,…,K},\psi:\mathcal{H}\to[K]:=\{1,\dots,K\},

    such that

    C:=ϕ​(H),Z:=ψ​(H).C:=\phi(H),\qquad Z:=\psi(H).

    Since 𝒞\mathcal{C} is standard Borel and [K][K] is finite, the regular conditional objects used below exist.

  4. 4.

    Integrable utility. For each a∈𝒜a\in\mathcal{A}, there exists a measurable utility function

    U​(⋅,a):ℋ→ℝU(\cdot,a):\mathcal{H}\to\mathbb{R}

    such that

    𝔼​[|U​(H,a)|]<∞.\mathbb{E}\big[\,|U(H,a)|\,\big]<\infty.

    In our application, U​(H,a)U(H,a) can be instantiated as a continuation utility or continuation value associated with choosing action
    aa at decision point HH.

Definition 1 (Conditional mean utilities and stage probabilities).

Adopt Assumption 1. For each a∈𝒜a\in\mathcal{A}, fix measurable versions

q¯​(⋅,a):𝒞→ℝ,q​(⋅,⋅,a):𝒞×[K]→ℝ\bar{q}(\cdot,a):\mathcal{C}\to\mathbb{R},\qquad
q(\cdot,\cdot,a):\mathcal{C}\times[K]\to\mathbb{R}

such that

q¯​(C,a)=𝔼​[U​(H,a)∣σ​(C)]almost surely,\bar{q}(C,a)=\mathbb{E}\!\left[U(H,a)\mid\sigma(C)\right]\qquad\text{almost surely,}

and

q​(C,Z,a)=𝔼​[U​(H,a)∣σ​(C,Z)]almost surely.q(C,Z,a)=\mathbb{E}\!\left[U(H,a)\mid\sigma(C,Z)\right]\qquad\text{almost surely.}

For each z∈[K]z\in[K], fix a measurable version

p​(z∣⋅):𝒞→[0,1]p(z\mid\cdot):\mathcal{C}\to[0,1]

such that

p​(z∣C)=ℙ​(Z=z∣σ​(C))almost surely.p(z\mid C)=\mathbb{P}\!\left(Z=z\mid\sigma(C)\right)\qquad\text{almost surely.}

We write

ℙC:=ℙ∘C−1\mathbb{P}_{C}:=\mathbb{P}\circ C^{-1}

for the law of CC, and define the stage support at a context c∈𝒞c\in\mathcal{C} by

S​(c):={z∈[K]:p​(z∣c)>0}.S(c):=\{z\in[K]:p(z\mid c)>0\}.

Remark 1 (Well-definedness).

Because 𝒜\mathcal{A} is finite and each U​(H,a)U(H,a) is integrable, the random variables q¯​(C,a)\bar{q}(C,a) and
q​(C,Z,a)q(C,Z,a) are integrable for every a∈𝒜a\in\mathcal{A}. Indeed, by Jensen’s inequality for conditional expectations,

|q¯(C,a)|=|𝔼[U(H,a)∣σ(C)]|≤𝔼[|U(H,a)|∣σ(C)]a.s.,|\bar{q}(C,a)|=\left|\mathbb{E}[U(H,a)\mid\sigma(C)]\right|\leq\mathbb{E}[|U(H,a)|\mid\sigma(C)]\qquad\text{a.s.,}

and therefore

𝔼​[|q¯​(C,a)|]≤𝔼​[|U​(H,a)|]<∞.\mathbb{E}\big[\,|\bar{q}(C,a)|\,\big]\leq\mathbb{E}\big[\,|U(H,a)|\,\big]<\infty.

The same argument gives

𝔼​[|q​(C,Z,a)|]<∞.\mathbb{E}\big[\,|q(C,Z,a)|\,\big]<\infty.

Hence all expectations below are finite.

Definition 2 (Flat and stage-conditioned decision values).

Adopt Assumption 1 and Definition 1. We define

Vflat:=𝔼​[maxa∈𝒜⁡q¯​(C,a)],Vstage:=𝔼​[maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(C,Z,a)].V_{\mathrm{flat}}:=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\bar{q}(C,a)\right],\qquad
V_{\mathrm{stage}}:=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(C,Z,a)\right].

These are exactly the appendix versions of the quantities appearing in Theorem 1 in the main text. Equivalently,

Vflat=𝔼​[maxa∈𝒜⁡𝔼​[U​(H,a)∣C]],Vstage=𝔼​[maxa∈𝒜⁡𝔼​[U​(H,a)∣C,Z]].V_{\mathrm{flat}}=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\mathbb{E}[U(H,a)\mid
C]\right],\qquad V_{\mathrm{stage}}=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\mathbb{E}[U(H,a)\mid C,Z]\right].

The following lemma is the only structural identity needed in the proof of Theorem 1.

Lemma 1 (Collapsing stage-conditioned utility to the flat information structure).

Adopt Assumption 1 and Definition 1. Then for every action a∈𝒜a\in\mathcal{A},

q¯​(C,a)=∑z=1Kp​(z∣C)​q​(C,z,a)almost surely.\bar{q}(C,a)=\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid C)\,q(C,z,a)\qquad\text{almost surely.}

Proof.

Fix an arbitrary action a∈𝒜a\in\mathcal{A}. Define the random variable

Ra:=∑z=1Kp​(z∣C)​q​(C,z,a).R_{a}:=\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid C)\,q(C,z,a).

We will prove that RaR_{a} is a version of 𝔼​[U​(H,a)∣σ​(C)]\mathbb{E}[U(H,a)\mid\sigma(C)]. Since q¯​(C,a)\bar{q}(C,a) is
also a version of 𝔼​[U​(H,a)∣σ​(C)]\mathbb{E}[U(H,a)\mid\sigma(C)] by Definition 1, the conclusion will follow.

We first note that RaR_{a} is σ​(C)\sigma(C)-measurable. Indeed, for each fixed zz, both p​(z∣C)p(z\mid C) and q​(C,z,a)q(C,z,a) are
σ​(C)\sigma(C)-measurable, so their product is σ​(C)\sigma(C)-measurable, and a finite sum of such terms is again
σ​(C)\sigma(C)-measurable.

It remains to verify the defining property of conditional expectation. Let GG be any bounded σ​(C)\sigma(C)-measurable random variable. We
must show that

𝔼​[G​Ra]=𝔼​[G​U​(H,a)].\mathbb{E}[GR_{a}]=\mathbb{E}[GU(H,a)].

Starting from the left-hand side and expanding the definition of RaR_{a}, we obtain

𝔼​[G​Ra]\displaystyle\mathbb{E}[GR_{a}]

=𝔼​[G​∑z=1Kp​(z∣C)​q​(C,z,a)]\displaystyle=\mathbb{E}\!\left[G\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid C)\,q(C,z,a)\right]

=∑z=1K𝔼​[G​p​(z∣C)​q​(C,z,a)].\displaystyle=\sum_{z=1}^{K}\mathbb{E}\!\left[G\,p(z\mid C)\,q(C,z,a)\right].

For each fixed zz, the random variable G​q​(C,z,a)Gq(C,z,a) is σ​(C)\sigma(C)-measurable and integrable. Therefore, by the defining
property of conditional expectation,

𝔼​[G​p​(z∣C)​q​(C,z,a)]\displaystyle\mathbb{E}\!\left[G\,p(z\mid C)\,q(C,z,a)\right]

=𝔼​[G​q​(C,z,a)​𝔼​[𝟏​{Z=z}∣σ​(C)]]\displaystyle=\mathbb{E}\!\left[G\,q(C,z,a)\,\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{1}\{Z=z\}\mid\sigma(C)]\right]

=𝔼​[G​q​(C,z,a)​ 1​{Z=z}].\displaystyle=\mathbb{E}\!\left[G\,q(C,z,a)\,\mathbf{1}\{Z=z\}\right].

Summing over zz yields

𝔼​[G​Ra]\displaystyle\mathbb{E}[GR_{a}]

=∑z=1K𝔼​[G​q​(C,z,a)​ 1​{Z=z}]\displaystyle=\sum_{z=1}^{K}\mathbb{E}\!\left[G\,q(C,z,a)\,\mathbf{1}\{Z=z\}\right]

=𝔼​[G​∑z=1K𝟏​{Z=z}​q​(C,z,a)]\displaystyle=\mathbb{E}\!\left[G\sum_{z=1}^{K}\mathbf{1}\{Z=z\}\,q(C,z,a)\right]

=𝔼​[G​q​(C,Z,a)]\displaystyle=\mathbb{E}\!\left[Gq\left(C,Z,a\right)\right]

By Definition 1,

q​(C,Z,a)=𝔼​[U​(H,a)∣σ​(C,Z)]almost surely.q(C,Z,a)=\mathbb{E}[U(H,a)\mid\sigma(C,Z)]\qquad\text{almost surely.}

Because GG is σ​(C)\sigma(C)-measurable and σ​(C)⊆σ​(C,Z)\sigma(C)\subseteq\sigma(C,Z), the random variable GG is also
σ​(C,Z)\sigma(C,Z)-measurable. Applying the defining property of conditional expectation once more gives

𝔼​[G​q​(C,Z,a)]=𝔼​[G​U​(H,a)].\mathbb{E}\!\left[G\,q(C,Z,a)\right]=\mathbb{E}\!\left[G\,U(H,a)\right].

Combining the previous displays, we conclude that

𝔼​[G​Ra]=𝔼​[G​U​(H,a)]\mathbb{E}[GR_{a}]=\mathbb{E}[GU(H,a)]

for every bounded σ​(C)\sigma(C)-measurable random variable GG. This finishes the proof.

∎

Definition 3 (Aliasing gap).

Adopt Assumption 1 and Definition 1. For c∈𝒞c\in\mathcal{C}, define the stage-aliasing gap

Δalias​(c):=∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(c,z,a)−maxa∈𝒜​∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​q​(c,z,a).\Delta_{\mathrm{alias}}(c):=\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid
c)\,\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(c,z,a)-\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid c)\,q(c,z,a).

Since 𝒜\mathcal{A} and [K][K] are finite and the chosen versions p,qp,q are measurable, the function
Δalias:𝒞→ℝ\Delta_{\mathrm{alias}}:\mathcal{C}\to\mathbb{R} is measurable.

We can now restate and strengthen the theorem from the main text.

Theorem 2 (Restatement and strengthening of Theorem 1).

Adopt Assumption 1 and Definitions 1–3. Then

Vstage−Vflat=𝔼​[Δalias​(C)]≥0.V_{\mathrm{stage}}-V_{\mathrm{flat}}=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\Delta_{\mathrm{alias}}(C)\right]\geq 0.

Consequently,

Vstage≥Vflat.V_{\mathrm{stage}}\geq V_{\mathrm{flat}}.

Moreover, for ℙC\mathbb{P}_{C}-almost every c∈𝒞c\in\mathcal{C}, the following are equivalent:

  1. 1.

    Δalias​(c)=0\Delta_{\mathrm{alias}}(c)=0.

  2. 2.

    There exists an action

    ac⋆∈⋂z∈S​(c)arg⁡maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(c,z,a).a_{c}^{\star}\in\bigcap_{z\in S(c)}\arg\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(c,z,a).

In particular, if there exists a measurable set 𝒞0⊆𝒞\mathcal{C}_{0}\subseteq\mathcal{C} with

ℙC​(𝒞0)>0\mathbb{P}_{C}(\mathcal{C}_{0})>0

and two distinct stages z� z′z\neq z^{\prime} such that for every c∈𝒞0c\in\mathcal{C}_{0},

p​(z∣c)>0,p​(z′∣c)>0,arg⁡maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(c,z,a)∩arg⁡maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(c,z′,a)=∅,p(z\mid c)>0,\qquad p(z^{\prime}\mid
c)>0,\qquad\arg\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(c,z,a)\;\cap\;\arg\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(c,z^{\prime},a)=\varnothing,

then

Vstage>Vflat.V_{\mathrm{stage}}>V_{\mathrm{flat}}.

Proof.

First, we rewrite VstageV_{\mathrm{stage}} and VflatV_{\mathrm{flat}} to show their subtraction form as in
𝔼​[△alias​(C)]\mathbb{E}\left[\triangle_{\mathrm{alias}}(C)\right]. By Definition 2,

Vstage=𝔼​[maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(C,Z,a)].V_{\mathrm{stage}}=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(C,Z,a)\right].

For each fixed z∈[K]z\in[K], define

Mz​(C):=maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(C,z,a).M_{z}(C):=\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(C,z,a).

Since 𝒜\mathcal{A} is finite and q​(⋅,z,a)q(\cdot,z,a) is measurable for each aa, the random variable Mz​(C)M_{z}(C) is
σ​(C)\sigma(C)-measurable. Also, because ZZ takes values in the finite set [K][K],

maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(C,Z,a)=∑z=1K𝟏​{Z=z}​Mz​(C)almost
surely.\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(C,Z,a)=\sum_{z=1}^{K}\mathbf{1}\{Z=z\}\,M_{z}(C)\qquad\text{almost surely.}

Taking conditional expectation given σ​(C)\sigma(C), we obtain

𝔼​[maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(C,Z,a)∣σ​(C)]\displaystyle\mathbb{E}\!\left[\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(C,Z,a)\mid\sigma(C)\right]

=𝔼​[∑z=1K𝟏​{Z=z}​Mz​(C)∣σ​(C)]\displaystyle=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\sum_{z=1}^{K}\mathbf{1}\{Z=z\}M_{z}(C)\mid\sigma(C)\right]

=∑z=1K𝔼​[𝟏​{Z=z}​Mz​(C)∣σ​(C)]\displaystyle=\sum_{z=1}^{K}\mathbb{E}\!\left[\mathbf{1}\{Z=z\}M_{z}(C)\mid\sigma(C)\right]

=∑z=1KMz​(C)​𝔼​[𝟏​{Z=z}∣σ​(C)]\displaystyle=\sum_{z=1}^{K}M_{z}(C)\,\mathbb{E}\!\left[\mathbf{1}\{Z=z\}\mid\sigma(C)\right]

=∑z=1Kp​(z∣C)​Mz​(C).\displaystyle=\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid C)\,M_{z}(C).

Taking expectation once more and using the tower property gives

Vstage=𝔼​[∑z=1Kp​(z∣C)​maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(C,z,a)].V_{\mathrm{stage}}=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid
C)\,\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(C,z,a)\right].

We next rewrite VflatV_{\mathrm{flat}}. By Definition 2,

Vflat=𝔼​[maxa∈𝒜⁡q¯​(C,a)].V_{\mathrm{flat}}=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\bar{q}(C,a)\right].

By Lemma 1,

q¯​(C,a)=∑z=1Kp​(z∣C)​q​(C,z,a)almost surely.\bar{q}(C,a)=\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid C)\,q(C,z,a)\qquad\text{almost surely.}

Substituting this identity into the preceding display yields

Vflat=𝔼​[maxa∈𝒜​∑z=1Kp​(z∣C)​q​(C,z,a)].V_{\mathrm{flat}}=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid
C)\,q(C,z,a)\right].

Then we can simply see that by Definition 3

Vstage−Vflat=𝔼​[∑z=1Kp​(z∣C)​maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(C,z,a)−maxa∈𝒜​∑z=1Kp​(z∣C)​q​(C,z,a)]=𝔼​[Δalias​(C)].V_{\mathrm{stage}}-V_{\mathrm{flat}}=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid
C)\,\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(C,z,a)-\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid
C)\,q(C,z,a)\right]=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\Delta_{\mathrm{alias}}(C)\right].

It remains to show that Δalias​(c)≥0\Delta_{\mathrm{alias}}(c)\geq 0 for every cc. Fix an arbitrary c∈𝒞c\in\mathcal{C}. For every
action a∈𝒜a\in\mathcal{A} and every stage z∈[K]z\in[K], we have

q​(c,z,a)≤maxa′∈𝒜⁡q​(c,z,a′).q(c,z,a)\leq\max_{a^{\prime}\in\mathcal{A}}q(c,z,a^{\prime}).

Multiplying both sides by the nonnegative quantity p​(z∣c)p(z\mid c) and summing over zz gives

∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​q​(c,z,a)≤∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​maxa′∈𝒜⁡q​(c,z,a′).\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid
c)\,q(c,z,a)\leq\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid c)\,\max_{a^{\prime}\in\mathcal{A}}q(c,z,a^{\prime}).

Since this inequality holds for every a∈𝒜a\in\mathcal{A}, it continues to hold after taking the maximum over aa on the left-hand side,
and this means that Δalias​(c)≥0\Delta_{\mathrm{alias}}(c)\geq 0. Therefore

Vstage−Vflat=𝔼​[Δalias​(C)]≥0,V_{\mathrm{stage}}-V_{\mathrm{flat}}=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\Delta_{\mathrm{alias}}(C)\right]\geq 0,

which implies

Vstage≥Vflat.V_{\mathrm{stage}}\geq V_{\mathrm{flat}}.

Then we are ready to make characterizations when the stage-aliasing gap is zero. Since 𝒜\mathcal{A} is finite and nonempty, there exists
at least one action

acflat∈arg⁡maxa∈𝒜​∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​q​(c,z,a).a_{c}^{\mathrm{flat}}\in\arg\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid
c)\,q(c,z,a).

By Definition 3,

Δalias​(c)\displaystyle\Delta_{\mathrm{alias}}(c)

=∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​Mz​(c)−∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​q​(c,z,acflat)\displaystyle=\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid c)\,M_{z}(c)-\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid
c)\,q(c,z,a_{c}^{\mathrm{flat}})

=∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​(Mz​(c)−q​(c,z,acflat)).\displaystyle=\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid c)\,\big(M_{z}(c)-q(c,z,a_{c}^{\mathrm{flat}})\big).

Each summand on the right-hand side is nonnegative, because Mz​(c)M_{z}(c) is the maximum of q​(c,z,⋅)q(c,z,\cdot) over
𝒜\mathcal{A}. We now prove the two directions separately.

(i) If Δalias​(c)=0\Delta_{\mathrm{alias}}(c)=0, then there exists a common maximizer over S​(c)S(c). This implies that

∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​(Mz​(c)−q​(c,z,acflat))=0.\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid c)\,\big(M_{z}(c)-q(c,z,a_{c}^{\mathrm{flat}})\big)=0.

Every term in the sum is nonnegative. Therefore, for every zz such that p​(z∣c)>0p(z\mid c)>0, we must have

Mz​(c)−q​(c,z,acflat)=0,M_{z}(c)-q(c,z,a_{c}^{\mathrm{flat}})=0,

i.e.,

q​(c,z,acflat)=Mz​(c)=maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(c,z,a).q(c,z,a_{c}^{\mathrm{flat}})=M_{z}(c)=\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(c,z,a).

Hence

acflat∈arg⁡maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(c,z,a)for every� ​z∈S​(c).a_{c}^{\mathrm{flat}}\in\arg\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(c,z,a)\qquad\text{for
every }z\in S(c).

Equivalently,

acflat∈⋂z∈S​(c)arg⁡maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(c,z,a),a_{c}^{\mathrm{flat}}\in\bigcap_{z\in S(c)}\arg\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(c,z,a),

so a common maximizer exists.

(ii) If there exists a common maximizer over S​(c)S(c), then Δalias​(c)=0\Delta_{\mathrm{alias}}(c)=0.

Conversely, assume there exists an action

ac⋆∈⋂z∈S​(c)arg⁡maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(c,z,a).a_{c}^{\star}\in\bigcap_{z\in S(c)}\arg\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(c,z,a).

Then for every z∈S​(c)z\in S(c),

q​(c,z,ac⋆)=Mz​(c).q(c,z,a_{c}^{\star})=M_{z}(c).

For z∉S​(c)z\notin S(c), we have p​(z∣c)=0p(z\mid c)=0, so those stages contribute nothing to any weighted sum below. Hence

∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​q​(c,z,ac⋆)=∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​Mz​(c).\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid c)\,q(c,z,a_{c}^{\star})=\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid
c)\,M_{z}(c).

Since ac⋆a_{c}^{\star} is one feasible action in the maximization,

maxa∈𝒜​∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​q​(c,z,a)≥∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​q​(c,z,ac⋆)=∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​Mz​(c).\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid
c)\,q(c,z,a)\geq\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid c)\,q(c,z,a_{c}^{\star})=\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid c)\,M_{z}(c).

On the other hand, the following is obvious and has been shown above

maxa∈𝒜​∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​q​(c,z,a)≤∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​Mz​(c).\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid
c)\,q(c,z,a)\leq\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid c)\,M_{z}(c).

Therefore equality holds:

maxa∈𝒜​∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​q​(c,z,a)=∑z=1Kp​(z∣c)​Mz​(c),\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid
c)\,q(c,z,a)=\sum_{z=1}^{K}p(z\mid c)\,M_{z}(c),

which is exactly

Δalias​(c)=0.\Delta_{\mathrm{alias}}(c)=0.

Combining (i) and (ii), we conclude that for every c∈𝒞c\in\mathcal{C},

Δalias​(c)=0⟺⋂z∈S​(c)arg⁡maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(c,z,a)� ∅.\Delta_{\mathrm{alias}}(c)=0\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad\bigcap_{z\in
S(c)}\arg\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(c,z,a)\neq\varnothing.

Since all objects are defined only up to ℙC\mathbb{P}_{C}-null sets through the chosen versions of conditional expectations and conditional
probabilities, the equivalence is interpreted for ℙC\mathbb{P}_{C}-almost every cc.

Finally, we can prove the strict inequality criterion. Assume there exists a measurable set 𝒞0⊆𝒞\mathcal{C}_{0}\subseteq\mathcal{C}
such that

ℙC​(𝒞0)>0\mathbb{P}_{C}(\mathcal{C}_{0})>0

and two distinct stages z� z′z\neq z^{\prime} such that for every c∈𝒞0c\in\mathcal{C}_{0},

p​(z∣c)>0,p​(z′∣c)>0,arg⁡maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(c,z,a)∩arg⁡maxa∈𝒜⁡q​(c,z′,a)=∅.p(z\mid c)>0,\qquad p(z^{\prime}\mid
c)>0,\qquad\arg\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(c,z,a)\cap\arg\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q(c,z^{\prime},a)=\varnothing.

By the zero-gap equivalence we proved above, and that we know Δalias​(c)≥0\Delta_{\mathrm{alias}}(c)\geq 0, this means that
Δalias​(C)≥0\Delta_{\mathrm{alias}}(C)\geq 0 almost surely, and thus

Vstage>Vflat.V_{\mathrm{stage}}>V_{\mathrm{flat}}.

This completes the proof. ∎

Remark 2 (Interpretation).

Theorem 2 strengthens the main-text theorem in two ways. First, it identifies the exact gain from making the stage label explicit:

Vstage−Vflat=𝔼​[Δalias​(C)].V_{\mathrm{stage}}-V_{\mathrm{flat}}=\mathbb{E}[\Delta_{\mathrm{alias}}(C)].

Second, it shows that the gain is strict exactly when the compressed context CC aliases decision points whose stage-conditioned optimal
actions disagree, which is the usual case. This is the precise sense in which explicit stage structure helps reasoning under compressed local
context.


E.2 Judge-Aligned Stage-Weighted Credit Assignment

This subsection formalizes the main-text intuition behind Theorem 3. As in Appendix E.1, we work on a probability space
(Ω,ℱ,ℙ)(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}). However, unlike Appendix E.1, which studies a single random decision point, we now analyze full
rollouts and their policy-gradient signals.

Setup and notation.

We suppress the rollout index ii used in Section 3.3 and analyze a single generic rollout. Let τ\tau denote a rollout sampled from a
policy-induced distribution pθ​(τ)p_{\theta}(\tau), and let ℬk\mathcal{B}_{k} denote the token set of stage kk, matching the notation
in the main text. For each token step tt, let

Ht:=(q,a<t,o<t)H_{t}:=(q,a_{<t},o_{<t})

denote the random history before taking action ata_{t}, and define the stage score-function sum

Γk:=∑t∈ℬk∇θlog⁡πθ​(at∣Ht).\Gamma_{k}:=\sum_{t\in\mathcal{B}_{k}}\nabla_{\theta}\log\pi_{\theta}(a_{t}\mid H_{t}).

We assume πθ​(a∣h)\pi_{\theta}(a\mid h) is differentiable in θ\theta, the environment dynamics are independent of θ\theta, and
Γk\Gamma_{k} is square-integrable for every kk.

For each stage k∈[K]k\in[K], let

Rk:Ω→ℝR_{k}:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}

denote the observed stagewise judge score, and let

Yk:Ω→ℝY_{k}:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}

denote a latent true process score for stage kk. Both are assumed integrable.

As in Section 3.3, let

Λ=(λk,j)∈[0,1]K×K\Lambda=(\lambda_{k,j})\in[0,1]^{K\times K}

be a causal stage-weight matrix satisfying

λk,j=0for� ​j<k,λk,k=1.\lambda_{k,j}=0\quad\text{for }j<k,\qquad\lambda_{k,k}=1.

Definitions.

For each stage kk, define the oracle process-level gradient contribution

gk⋆:=∑j=kKλk,j𝔼[ΓkYj].g_{k}^{\star}:=\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}\,\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}Y_{j}].

(2)

This is the stage-kk gradient contribution that would be induced by the stage-dependent return
Gi,kΛ:=∑j=kKλk,j​Ri,jG_{i,k}^{\Lambda}:=\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}R_{i,j} if the latent true stage scores were directly observable.

Define the judge-induced stage-weighted signal

gkΛ:=∑j=kKλk,j​𝔼​[Γk​Rj],g_{k}^{\Lambda}:=\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}\,\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}R_{j}],

(3)

and the terminal-broadcast signal

gkterm:=𝔼​[Γk​RK],g_{k}^{\mathrm{term}}:=\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}R_{K}],

(4)

Finally, define

MkΛ:=‖𝔼​[Γk​YK]−∑j=kKλk,j​𝔼​[Γk​Yj]‖2.M_{k}^{\Lambda}:=\left\|\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}Y_{K}]-\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}\,\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}Y_{j}]\right\|_{2}.

(5)

The quantity MkΛM_{k}^{\Lambda} measures how much oracle process-level signal is omitted when one uses only the final-stage score YKY_{K}
instead of the full stage-weighted oracle target.

Assumption 2 (Judge alignment).

For each stage pair k≤jk\leq j, there exists a constant ϵk,j≥0\epsilon_{k,j}\geq 0 such that

‖𝔼​[Γk​(Rj−Yj)]‖2≤ϵk,j.\left\|\mathbb{E}\!\left[\Gamma_{k}(R_{j}-Y_{j})\right]\right\|_{2}\leq\epsilon_{k,j}.

(6)

That is, the observed judge score RjR_{j} approximates the latent true score YjY_{j} in the gradient-relevant direction defined by
Γk\Gamma_{k}.

Theorem 3 (Benefit of stage-weighted credit, informal).

If the omitted true intermediate signal outweighs the cumulative judge misalignment, then stage-weighted credit yields a strictly better
gradient approximation:

‖gkΛ−gk⋆‖2<‖gkterm−gk⋆‖2.\|g_{k}^{\Lambda}-g_{k}^{\star}\|_{2}<\|g_{k}^{\mathrm{term}}-g_{k}^{\star}\|_{2}.

Theorem 4 (Formal version of Theorem 3).

Under Assumption 2, the following hold for every stage k∈[K]k\in[K].

  1. 1.

    Error of the stage-weighted signal relative to the oracle target:

    ‖gkΛ−gk⋆‖2≤∑j=kKλk,j​ϵk,j.\left\|g_{k}^{\Lambda}-g_{k}^{\star}\right\|_{2}\leq\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}\,\epsilon_{k,j}.

  2. 2.

    Lower bound for terminal broadcast relative to the oracle target:

    ‖gkterm−gk⋆‖2≥MkΛ−ϵk,K.\left\|g_{k}^{\mathrm{term}}-g_{k}^{\star}\right\|_{2}\geq M_{k}^{\Lambda}-\epsilon_{k,K}.

  3. 3.

    Comparison. If

    ∑j=kKλk,j​ϵk,j<MkΛ−ϵk,K,\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}\,\epsilon_{k,j}<M_{k}^{\Lambda}-\epsilon_{k,K},

    then

    ‖gkΛ−gk⋆‖2<‖gkterm−gk⋆‖2.\left\|g_{k}^{\Lambda}-g_{k}^{\star}\right\|_{2}<\left\|g_{k}^{\mathrm{term}}-g_{k}^{\star}\right\|_{2}.

In particular, when judge misalignment is sufficiently small relative to the omitted intermediate-stage oracle signal, the stage-weighted
signal is strictly closer than terminal broadcast to the intended process-level gradient contribution.

Proof.

Fix a stage kk. First, we show (1). By definition 3 and 2,

gkΛ−gk⋆=∑j=kKλk,j​𝔼​[Γk​Rj]−∑j=kKλk,j​𝔼​[Γk​Yj]=∑j=kKλk,j​𝔼​[Γk​(Rj−Yj)].g_{k}^{\Lambda}-g_{k}^{\star}=\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}\,\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}R_{j}]-\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}\,\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}Y_{j}]=\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}\,\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}(R_{j}-Y_{j})].

Taking the Euclidean norm and applying the triangle inequality yields

‖gkΛ−gk⋆‖2≤∑j=kKλk,j​‖𝔼​[Γk​(Rj−Yj)]‖2.\left\|g_{k}^{\Lambda}-g_{k}^{\star}\right\|_{2}\leq\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}\left\|\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}(R_{j}-Y_{j})]\right\|_{2}.

Applying Assumption 2 results in the desired form,

‖gkΛ−gk⋆‖2≤∑j=kKλk,j​ϵk,j.\left\|g_{k}^{\Lambda}-g_{k}^{\star}\right\|_{2}\leq\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}\,\epsilon_{k,j}.

Second, we try to prove (2). By definition 4 and 2,

gkterm−gk⋆=𝔼​[Γk​RK]−∑j=kKλk,j​𝔼​[Γk​Yj]=𝔼​[Γk​(RK−YK)]⏟=⁣:Ek+(𝔼​[Γk​YK]−∑j=kKλk,j​𝔼​[Γk​Yj])⏟=⁣:Dk.g_{k}^{\mathrm{term}}-g_{k}^{\star}=\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}R_{K}]-\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}\,\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}Y_{j}]=\underbrace{\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}(R_{K}-Y_{K})]}_{=:E_{k}}+\underbrace{\left(\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}Y_{K}]-\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}\,\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}Y_{j}]\right)}_{=:D_{k}}.

From definition 5 we know that ‖Dk‖2=MkΛ\|D_{k}\|_{2}=M_{k}^{\Lambda} Applying the reverse triangle inequality,

‖Ek+Dk‖2≥‖Dk‖2−‖Ek‖2,\|E_{k}+D_{k}\|_{2}\geq\|D_{k}\|_{2}-\|E_{k}\|_{2},

we obtain

‖gkterm−gk⋆‖2≥MkΛ−‖𝔼​[Γk​(RK−YK)]‖2.\left\|g_{k}^{\mathrm{term}}-g_{k}^{\star}\right\|_{2}\geq
M_{k}^{\Lambda}-\left\|\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}(R_{K}-Y_{K})]\right\|_{2}.

Using Assumption 2 with j=Kj=K,

‖𝔼​[Γk​(RK−YK)]‖2≤ϵk,K.\left\|\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}(R_{K}-Y_{K})]\right\|_{2}\leq\epsilon_{k,K}.

Hence

‖gkterm−gk⋆‖2≥MkΛ−ϵk,K.\left\|g_{k}^{\mathrm{term}}-g_{k}^{\star}\right\|_{2}\geq M_{k}^{\Lambda}-\epsilon_{k,K}.

Finally, we are ready to state the last result. We have shown that

‖gkΛ−gk⋆‖2≤∑j=kKλk,j​ϵk,j,‖gkterm−gk⋆‖2≥MkΛ−ϵk,K.\left\|g_{k}^{\Lambda}-g_{k}^{\star}\right\|_{2}\leq\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}\,\epsilon_{k,j},\qquad\qquad\left\|g_{k}^{\mathrm{term}}-g_{k}^{\star}\right\|_{2}\geq
M_{k}^{\Lambda}-\epsilon_{k,K}.

Therefore, if

∑j=kKλk,j​ϵk,j<MkΛ−ϵk,K,\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}\,\epsilon_{k,j}<M_{k}^{\Lambda}-\epsilon_{k,K},

then

‖gkΛ−gk⋆‖2<‖gkterm−gk⋆‖2.\left\|g_{k}^{\Lambda}-g_{k}^{\star}\right\|_{2}<\left\|g_{k}^{\mathrm{term}}-g_{k}^{\star}\right\|_{2}.

This proves item 3 and completes the proof. ∎

Corollary 1 (A sufficient condition from score MSE).

Suppose in addition that for some constants Bk≥0B_{k}\geq 0 and δj≥0\delta_{j}\geq 0,

𝔼​[‖Γk‖22]≤Bk,𝔼​[(Rj−Yj)2]≤δj2.\mathbb{E}[\|\Gamma_{k}\|_{2}^{2}]\leq
B_{k},\qquad\mathbb{E}[(R_{j}-Y_{j})^{2}]\leq\delta_{j}^{2}.

Then Assumption 2 holds with

ϵk,j:=Bk​δj.\epsilon_{k,j}:=\sqrt{B_{k}}\,\delta_{j}.

Consequently,

‖gkΛ−gk⋆‖2≤Bk​∑j=kKλk,j​δj,\left\|g_{k}^{\Lambda}-g_{k}^{\star}\right\|_{2}\leq\sqrt{B_{k}}\sum_{j=k}^{K}\lambda_{k,j}\delta_{j},

and

‖gkterm−gk⋆‖2≥MkΛ−Bk​δK.\left\|g_{k}^{\mathrm{term}}-g_{k}^{\star}\right\|_{2}\geq M_{k}^{\Lambda}-\sqrt{B_{k}}\,\delta_{K}.

Proof.

Fix k≤jk\leq j. By Cauchy–Schwarz,

‖𝔼​[Γk​(Rj−Yj)]‖2\displaystyle\left\|\mathbb{E}[\Gamma_{k}(R_{j}-Y_{j})]\right\|_{2}

≤𝔼​[‖Γk‖2​|Rj−Yj|]\displaystyle\leq\mathbb{E}\!\left[\|\Gamma_{k}\|_{2}\,|R_{j}-Y_{j}|\right]

≤(𝔼​[‖Γk‖22])1/2​(𝔼​[(Rj−Yj)2])1/2\displaystyle\leq\left(\mathbb{E}[\|\Gamma_{k}\|_{2}^{2}]\right)^{1/2}\left(\mathbb{E}[(R_{j}-Y_{j})^{2}]\right)^{1/2}

≤Bk​δj.\displaystyle\leq\sqrt{B_{k}}\,\delta_{j}.

Thus Assumption 2 holds with ϵk,j=Bk​δj\epsilon_{k,j}=\sqrt{B_{k}}\delta_{j}. The displayed bounds then follow immediately from Theorem 4.
∎

Remark 3.

Theorem 4 and Corollary 1 highlight a fundamental trade-off: the advantage of stage-weighted credit depends on the strength of the omitted
intermediate-stage oracle signal MkΛM_{k}^{\Lambda} versus the quality of judge alignment, captured by the score errors δj\delta_{j}.
Crucially, this establishes that as long as the intermediate stages contain sufficient true process signal (i.e., MkΛM_{k}^{\Lambda} is
sufficiently large), the benefit of capturing this dense signal strictly outweighs the accumulated noise from an imperfect intermediate judge
δj>0\delta_{j}>0. In such regimes, stage-weighted credit serves as a strictly better approximation of the intended process objective than
relying solely on terminal broadcast.


E.3 Judge-Gated Co-Evolution of Policy and Rubric Bank

This subsection formalizes the third component of SCRIBE in Section 3.4. Unlike Appendix E.1, which studies the value of explicit stage
information, and Appendix E.2, which studies stagewise credit assignment, the object here is the self-evolution loop itself: the same shared
backbone both solves the current task and produces rubric-grounded reflections that can later be reused within-episode and across episodes.

The formalization below matches our implementation. The task objective updates trajectory tokens, whereas the reflection objective is
computed on reflection tokens only. Concretely, the selected rollout is treated as a fixed conditioning context during the reflection update,
so the reflection-utility gradient does not backpropagate through the sampled trajectory. The co-evolution effect therefore comes from
parameter sharing: task updates and reflection updates act on the same backbone parameters, even though they are computed from different
generated token blocks.

The key assumption below is a judge-gated local positive-transfer condition. This is not intended as a global claim that every generated
reflection is always useful throughout training. Rather, it isolates the local regime in which reflections that are accepted by the judge
behave like a helpful auxiliary objective. Similar gradient-similarity and positive-transfer conditions are standard in the
auxiliary-learning and multi-task optimization literature: helpful auxiliary objectives tend to align with the main-task gradient, whereas
misaligned gradients induce negative transfer [du2019adapting, wu2020understanding, yu2020gradient, liu2021conflict, wang2021gradient]. At
the same time, not all task combinations are beneficial to train together [standley2020which]. This perspective is also consistent with
theory on shared representation learning and task relevance in transfer [maurer2016benefit, tripuraneni2020theory, chen2022active].

Assumption 3 (Setup for judge-gated co-evolution).

Throughout this subsection, let Θ⊆ℝd\Theta\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d} be an open parameter domain. The following assumptions hold.

  1. 1.

    Query distribution for the task objective. There is a query random variable

    Q∼𝒟.Q\sim\mathcal{D}.

  2. 2.

    Current rubric bank. At the current training step, the rubric bank is a fixed measurable object ℳ\mathcal{M}. This corresponds to
    analyzing a single parameter update while treating the bank state as fixed.

  3. 3.

    Task rollout distribution. Given query Q=qQ=q and bank ℳ\mathcal{M}, a rollout

    T∼pθ(⋅∣q,ℳ)T\sim p_{\theta}(\cdot\mid q,\mathcal{M})

    is sampled from the deployed task policy.

  4. 4.

    Fixed reflection-context distribution. There exists a fixed measurable distribution ξ\xi over query–trajectory pairs

    (Q~,T~)∼ξ.(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T})\sim\xi.

    One may think of ξ\xi as the distribution of trajectories selected for reflection training at the current update, e.g., after first
    sampling rollout groups under the current behavior policy and then selecting one trajectory per query. For the local analysis in this
    subsection, ξ\xi is treated as fixed. This matches the implementation where the reflection objective applies gradients only on
    reflection tokens and treats the selected trajectory as a fixed prompt / context.

  5. 5.

    Shared-backbone reflection generation. Given (Q~,T~)=(q,τ)(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T})=(q,\tau) and bank ℳ\mathcal{M}, a
    rubric-grounded reflection

    S∼rθ(⋅∣q,τ,ℳ)S\sim r_{\theta}(\cdot\mid q,\tau,\mathcal{M})

    is sampled. Although we write pθp_{\theta} and rθr_{\theta} separately for clarity, both are induced by the same underlying
    autoregressive backbone πθ\pi_{\theta} under different prompts / contexts.

  6. 6.

    Task score, reflection-utility scores, and judge gate. There exist measurable, integrable random quantities

    R​(Q,T;ℳ)∈ℝ,Δw​(Q~,T~,S;ℳ)∈ℝ,Δc​(Q~,T~,S;ℳ)∈ℝ,R(Q,T;\mathcal{M})\in\mathbb{R},\qquad\Delta^{\mathrm{w}}(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T},S;\mathcal{M})\in\mathbb{R},\qquad\Delta^{\mathrm{c}}(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T},S;\mathcal{M})\in\mathbb{R},

    and a measurable acceptance indicator

    A​(Q~,T~,S;ℳ)∈{0,1}.A(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T},S;\mathcal{M})\in\{0,1\}.

    Here RR is the judged task score of the deployed rollout, Δw\Delta^{\mathrm{w}} is the judged within-episode usefulness of the
    reflection, Δc\Delta^{\mathrm{c}} is the judged cross-episode transfer usefulness, and A=1A=1 means that the reflection is judged
    sufficiently useful to be accepted for downstream adaptation / storage. These objects do not depend directly on θ\theta except through
    the sampled random variables and the fixed bank ℳ\mathcal{M}.

  7. 7.

    Differentiability and score-function regularity. For 𝒟\mathcal{D}-almost every qq, the conditional distribution
    pθ​(τ∣q,ℳ)p_{\theta}(\tau\mid q,\mathcal{M}) is differentiable in θ\theta. For ξ\xi-almost every (q,τ)(q,\tau), the
    conditional distribution rθ​(s∣q,τ,ℳ)r_{\theta}(s\mid q,\tau,\mathcal{M}) is differentiable in θ\theta. Differentiation may be
    interchanged with the expectations below, and all score-function terms introduced later are square-integrable.

  8. 8.

    Smoothness. The objectives JtaskJ_{\mathrm{task}} and UU defined below are continuously differentiable. Moreover, JtaskJ_{\mathrm{task}}
    is LJL_{J}-smooth and UU is LUL_{U}-smooth on Θ\Theta.

Definition 4 (Task objective and judge-gated memory objective).

Adopt Assumption 3. Define the task-rollout and reflection score-function sums

Γtraj:=∇θlogpθ(T∣Q,ℳ),Γref:=∇θlogrθ(S∣Q~,T~,ℳ).\Gamma^{\mathrm{traj}}:=\nabla_{\theta}\log p_{\theta}(T\mid
Q,\mathcal{M}),\qquad\Gamma^{\mathrm{ref}}:=\nabla_{\theta}\log r_{\theta}(S\mid\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T},\mathcal{M}).

Because both conditional distributions are induced by the same backbone πθ\pi_{\theta}, these admit tokenwise decompositions

Γtraj=∑t=1|T|∇θlog⁡πθ​(at∣ht),Γref=∑u=1|S|∇θlog⁡πθ​(su∣cu),\Gamma^{\mathrm{traj}}=\sum_{t=1}^{|T|}\nabla_{\theta}\log\pi_{\theta}(a_{t}\mid
h_{t}),\qquad\Gamma^{\mathrm{ref}}=\sum_{u=1}^{|S|}\nabla_{\theta}\log\pi_{\theta}(s_{u}\mid c_{u}),

for the appropriate rollout histories hth_{t} and reflection-generation contexts cuc_{u}.

For weights βw,βc≥0\beta_{\mathrm{w}},\beta_{\mathrm{c}}\geq 0, define

Jtask​(θ):=𝔼​[R​(Q,T;ℳ)],J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta):=\mathbb{E}\!\left[R(Q,T;\mathcal{M})\right],

where the expectation is with respect to

Q∼𝒟,T∼pθ(⋅∣Q,ℳ),Q\sim\mathcal{D},\qquad T\sim p_{\theta}(\cdot\mid Q,\mathcal{M}),

and define

U​(θ):=𝔼​[A​(Q~,T~,S;ℳ)​(βw​Δw​(Q~,T~,S;ℳ)+βc​Δc​(Q~,T~,S;ℳ))],U(\theta):=\mathbb{E}\!\left[A(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T},S;\mathcal{M})\Big(\beta_{\mathrm{w}}\Delta^{\mathrm{w}}(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T},S;\mathcal{M})+\beta_{\mathrm{c}}\Delta^{\mathrm{c}}(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T},S;\mathcal{M})\Big)\right],

where the expectation is with respect to

(Q~,T~)∼ξ,S∼rθ(⋅∣Q~,T~,ℳ).(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T})\sim\xi,\qquad S\sim
r_{\theta}(\cdot\mid\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T},\mathcal{M}).

We also define the combined co-evolution objective

Jcoevo​(θ):=Jtask​(θ)+U​(θ).J_{\mathrm{coevo}}(\theta):=J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta)+U(\theta).

Assumption 4 (Judge-gated local positive transfer).

Adopt Assumption 3 and Definition 4. Let

g:=∇Jtask​(θ),g:=\nabla J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta),

and define the ungated reflection-utility score-gradient random vector

Ψ:=Γref​(βw​Δw​(Q~,T~,S;ℳ)+βc​Δc​(Q~,T~,S;ℳ)).\Psi:=\Gamma^{\mathrm{ref}}\Big(\beta_{\mathrm{w}}\Delta^{\mathrm{w}}(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T},S;\mathcal{M})+\beta_{\mathrm{c}}\Delta^{\mathrm{c}}(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T},S;\mathcal{M})\Big).

Assume there exist constants p0∈(0,1]p_{0}\in(0,1] and μ>0\mu>0 such that

ℙ​(A=1)≥p0,⟨g,𝔼​[Ψ∣A=1]⟩≥μ.\mathbb{P}(A=1)\geq p_{0},\qquad\left\langle g,\,\mathbb{E}[\Psi\mid
A=1]\right\rangle\geq\mu.

That is, reflections that pass the judge are accepted with nontrivial probability, and their conditional expected gradient contribution is
positively aligned with the task gradient.

Theorem 5 (Judge-gated shared-backbone co-evolution).

Adopt Assumptions 3–4 and Definition 4. Let

g:=∇Jtask​(θ),h:=∇U​(θ).g:=\nabla J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta),\qquad h:=\nabla U(\theta).

Then the following hold.

  1. 1.

    Mutual improvement. For every step size η>0\eta>0,

    U​(θ+η​g)−U​(θ)≥η​p0​μ−LU​η22​‖g‖22,U(\theta+\eta g)-U(\theta)\geq\eta
    p_{0}\mu-\frac{L_{U}\eta^{2}}{2}\|g\|_{2}^{2},

    and

    Jtask​(θ+η​h)−Jtask​(θ)≥η​p0​μ−LJ​η22​‖h‖22.J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta+\eta
    h)-J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta)\geq\eta p_{0}\mu-\frac{L_{J}\eta^{2}}{2}\|h\|_{2}^{2}.

    In particular, if

    0<η<min⁡{2​p0​μLU​‖g‖22,2​p0​μLJ​‖h‖22},0<\eta<\min\left\{\frac{2p_{0}\mu}{L_{U}\|g\|_{2}^{2}},\frac{2p_{0}\mu}{L_{J}\|h\|_{2}^{2}}\right\},

    then a task-improving step also improves the judge-gated memory objective, and a memory-improving step also improves the task objective.

  2. 2.

    Dominance over task-only training with static memory. Consider the task-only update

    θstat+:=θ+η​g,\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+}:=\theta+\eta g,

    which updates the deployed task policy while assigning zero explicit training signal to reflection quality, and the co-evolution update

    θco+:=θ+η​(g+h).\theta_{\mathrm{co}}^{+}:=\theta+\eta(g+h).

    Then

    Jtask​(θco+)−Jtask​(θstat+)≥η​p0​μ−LJ​η2​‖g‖2​‖h‖2−LJ​η22​‖h‖22.J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{co}}^{+})-J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+})\geq\eta
    p_{0}\mu-L_{J}\eta^{2}\|g\|_{2}\|h\|_{2}-\frac{L_{J}\eta^{2}}{2}\|h\|_{2}^{2}.

    Consequently, if the reflection is sufficiently good,

    p0​μ>LJ​η​(‖g‖2​‖h‖2+12​‖h‖22),p_{0}\mu>L_{J}\eta\left(\|g\|_{2}\|h\|_{2}+\frac{1}{2}\|h\|_{2}^{2}\right),

    then

    Jtask​(θco+)>Jtask​(θstat+).J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{co}}^{+})>J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+}).

Proof.

To prove the desired statement, we first derive the formula for gg and hh. Let
μθ​(d​q,d​τ):=𝒟​(d​q)​pθ​(d​τ∣q,ℳ)\mu_{\theta}(dq,d\tau):=\mathcal{D}(dq)\,p_{\theta}(d\tau\mid q,\mathcal{M})
denote the joint law of (Q,T)(Q,T). By Definition 4,

Jtask​(θ)=∫R​(q,τ;ℳ)​μθ​(d​q,d​τ).J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta)=\int R(q,\tau;\mathcal{M})\,\mu_{\theta}(dq,d\tau).

By Assumption 3, differentiation may be interchanged with the integral. Since 𝒟\mathcal{D} does not depend on θ\theta, by the usual
log-derivative trick,

∇Jtask​(θ)\displaystyle\nabla J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta)

=∫R​(q,τ;ℳ)​∇pθ​(τ∣q,ℳ)​𝒟​(d​q)​𝑑τ\displaystyle=\int R(q,\tau;\mathcal{M})\,\nabla p_{\theta}(\tau\mid
q,\mathcal{M})\,\mathcal{D}(dq)\,d\tau

=∫R​(q,τ;ℳ)​pθ​(τ∣q,ℳ)​∇log⁡pθ​(τ∣q,ℳ)​𝒟​(d​q)​𝑑τ\displaystyle=\int
R(q,\tau;\mathcal{M})\,p_{\theta}(\tau\mid q,\mathcal{M})\,\nabla\log p_{\theta}(\tau\mid q,\mathcal{M})\,\mathcal{D}(dq)\,d\tau

=𝔼​[Γtraj​R​(Q,T;ℳ)].\displaystyle=\mathbb{E}\!\left[\Gamma^{\mathrm{traj}}R(Q,T;\mathcal{M})\right].

We next derive the formula for hh. Write

Δ​(q,τ,s;ℳ):=βw​Δw​(q,τ,s;ℳ)+βc​Δc​(q,τ,s;ℳ),\Delta(q,\tau,s;\mathcal{M}):=\beta_{\mathrm{w}}\Delta^{\mathrm{w}}(q,\tau,s;\mathcal{M})+\beta_{\mathrm{c}}\Delta^{\mathrm{c}}(q,\tau,s;\mathcal{M}),

so that

U​(θ)=𝔼​[A​(Q~,T~,S;ℳ)​Δ​(Q~,T~,S;ℳ)].U(\theta)=\mathbb{E}\!\left[A(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T},S;\mathcal{M})\,\Delta(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T},S;\mathcal{M})\right].

Let

νθ​(d​q,d​τ,d​s):=ξ​(d​q,d​τ)​rθ​(d​s∣q,τ,ℳ)\nu_{\theta}(dq,d\tau,ds):=\xi(dq,d\tau)\,r_{\theta}(ds\mid
q,\tau,\mathcal{M})

denote the joint law of (Q~,T~,S)(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T},S). Then

U​(θ)=∫A​(q,τ,s;ℳ)​Δ​(q,τ,s;ℳ)​νθ​(d​q,d​τ,d​s).U(\theta)=\int
A(q,\tau,s;\mathcal{M})\Delta(q,\tau,s;\mathcal{M})\,\nu_{\theta}(dq,d\tau,ds).

Differentiating under the integral sign gives

∇U​(θ)\displaystyle\nabla U(\theta)

=∫A​(q,τ,s;ℳ)​Δ​(q,τ,s;ℳ)​ξ​(d​q,d​τ)​∇rθ​(s∣q,τ,ℳ)​𝑑s\displaystyle=\int
A(q,\tau,s;\mathcal{M})\Delta(q,\tau,s;\mathcal{M})\,\xi(dq,d\tau)\,\nabla r_{\theta}(s\mid q,\tau,\mathcal{M})\,ds

=∫A​(q,τ,s;ℳ)​Δ​(q,τ,s;ℳ)​ξ​(d​q,d​τ)​rθ​(s∣q,τ,ℳ)​∇log⁡rθ​(s∣q,τ,ℳ)​𝑑s\displaystyle=\int
A(q,\tau,s;\mathcal{M})\Delta(q,\tau,s;\mathcal{M})\,\xi(dq,d\tau)\,r_{\theta}(s\mid q,\tau,\mathcal{M})\,\nabla\log r_{\theta}(s\mid
q,\tau,\mathcal{M})\,ds

=𝔼​[A​(Q~,T~,S;ℳ)​Γref​Δ​(Q~,T~,S;ℳ)]\displaystyle=\mathbb{E}\!\left[A(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T},S;\mathcal{M})\,\Gamma^{\mathrm{ref}}\,\Delta(\widetilde{Q},\widetilde{T},S;\mathcal{M})\right]

=𝔼​[A​Ψ]:=h.\displaystyle=\mathbb{E}\!\left[A\Psi\right]:=h.

By the definition of AA and Assumption 4,

𝔼​[A​Ψ]=ℙ​(A=1)​𝔼​[Ψ∣A=1].\mathbb{E}[A\Psi]=\mathbb{P}(A=1)\,\mathbb{E}[\Psi\mid A=1].

and that

⟨g,h⟩\displaystyle\langle g,h\rangle

=⟨g,ℙ​(A=1)​𝔼​[Ψ∣A=1]⟩\displaystyle=\left\langle g,\,\mathbb{P}(A=1)\,\mathbb{E}[\Psi\mid A=1]\right\rangle

(7)

=ℙ​(A=1)​⟨g,𝔼​[Ψ∣A=1]⟩\displaystyle=\mathbb{P}(A=1)\,\left\langle g,\,\mathbb{E}[\Psi\mid A=1]\right\rangle

(8)

≥p0​μ,\displaystyle\geq p_{0}\mu,

(9)

By the assumption 3, UU is LUL_{U}-smooth, for every vector v∈ℝdv\in\mathbb{R}^{d} we have the standard lower bound

U​(θ+v)≥U​(θ)+⟨∇U​(θ),v⟩−LU2​‖v‖22.U(\theta+v)\geq U(\theta)+\langle\nabla
U(\theta),v\rangle-\frac{L_{U}}{2}\|v\|_{2}^{2}.

Applying this with v=η​gv=\eta g and using Eq. 9 yields

U​(θ+η​g)−U​(θ)≥η​⟨h,g⟩−LU​η22​‖g‖22≥η​p0​μ−LU​η22​‖g‖22.U(\theta+\eta
g)-U(\theta)\geq\eta\langle h,g\rangle-\frac{L_{U}\eta^{2}}{2}\|g\|_{2}^{2}\geq\eta p_{0}\mu-\frac{L_{U}\eta^{2}}{2}\|g\|_{2}^{2}.

Likewise, because JtaskJ_{\mathrm{task}} is LJL_{J}-smooth,

Jtask​(θ+η​h)−Jtask​(θ)≥η​⟨g,h⟩−LJ​η22​‖h‖22≥η​p0​μ−LJ​η22​‖h‖22.J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta+\eta
h)-J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta)\geq\eta\langle g,h\rangle-\frac{L_{J}\eta^{2}}{2}\|h\|_{2}^{2}\geq\eta
p_{0}\mu-\frac{L_{J}\eta^{2}}{2}\|h\|_{2}^{2}.

If

0<η<min⁡{2​p0​μLU​‖g‖22,2​p0​μLJ​‖h‖22},0<\eta<\min\left\{\frac{2p_{0}\mu}{L_{U}\|g\|_{2}^{2}},\frac{2p_{0}\mu}{L_{J}\|h\|_{2}^{2}}\right\},

then both right-hand sides are strictly positive.

To prove the other part, define

ϕ​(t):=Jtask​(θstat++t​η​h),t∈[0,1].\phi(t):=J_{\mathrm{task}}\big(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+}+t\eta h\big),\qquad t\in[0,1].

Then

ϕ​(1)−ϕ​(0)=Jtask​(θco+)−Jtask​(θstat+)=∫01ϕ′​(t)​𝑑t.\phi(1)-\phi(0)=J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{co}}^{+})-J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+})=\int_{0}^{1}\phi^{\prime}(t)\,dt.

By the chain rule,

ϕ′​(t)=η​⟨∇Jtask​(θstat++t​η​h),h⟩.\phi^{\prime}(t)=\eta\left\langle\nabla
J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+}+t\eta h),h\right\rangle.

Since ∇Jtask\nabla J_{\mathrm{task}} is LJL_{J}-Lipschitz,

‖∇Jtask​(θstat++t​η​h)−∇Jtask​(θstat+)‖2≤LJ​t​η​‖h‖2.\left\|\nabla
J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+}+t\eta h)-\nabla J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+})\right\|_{2}\leq
L_{J}t\eta\|h\|_{2}.

Hence, for every t∈[0,1]t\in[0,1], by Cauchy-Schwarz

⟨∇Jtask​(θstat++t​η​h),h⟩≥⟨∇Jtask​(θstat+),h⟩−LJ​t​η​‖h‖22.\left\langle\nabla
J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+}+t\eta h),h\right\rangle\geq\left\langle\nabla
J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+}),h\right\rangle-L_{J}t\eta\|h\|_{2}^{2}.

Integrating from 0 to 11 gives

Jtask​(θco+)−Jtask​(θstat+)≥η​⟨∇Jtask​(θstat+),h⟩−LJ​η22​‖h‖22.J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{co}}^{+})-J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+})\geq\eta\left\langle\nabla
J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+}),h\right\rangle-\frac{L_{J}\eta^{2}}{2}\|h\|_{2}^{2}.

It remains to lower-bound the inner product on the right. Again by LJL_{J}-Lipschitz continuity of the gradient,

‖∇Jtask​(θstat+)−g‖2=‖∇Jtask​(θ+η​g)−∇Jtask​(θ)‖2≤LJ​η​‖g‖2.\left\|\nabla
J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+})-g\right\|_{2}=\left\|\nabla J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta+\eta g)-\nabla
J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta)\right\|_{2}\leq L_{J}\eta\|g\|_{2}.

Therefore, by Cauchy–Schwarz,

⟨∇Jtask​(θstat+),h⟩\displaystyle\left\langle\nabla J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+}),h\right\rangle

=⟨g,h⟩+⟨∇Jtask​(θstat+)−g,h⟩\displaystyle=\langle g,h\rangle+\left\langle\nabla
J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+})-g,h\right\rangle

≥⟨g,h⟩−‖∇Jtask​(θstat+)−g‖2​‖h‖2\displaystyle\geq\langle g,h\rangle-\left\|\nabla
J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+})-g\right\|_{2}\|h\|_{2}

≥⟨g,h⟩−LJ​η​‖g‖2​‖h‖2\displaystyle\geq\langle g,h\rangle-L_{J}\eta\|g\|_{2}\|h\|_{2}

≥p0​μ−LJ​η​‖g‖2​‖h‖2,\displaystyle\geq p_{0}\mu-L_{J}\eta\|g\|_{2}\|h\|_{2},

where the last step uses Eq. 9. Substituting this bound above yields that

Jtask​(θco+)−Jtask​(θstat+)≥η​p0​μ−LJ​η2​‖g‖2​‖h‖2−LJ​η22​‖h‖22.J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{co}}^{+})-J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+})\geq\eta
p_{0}\mu-L_{J}\eta^{2}\|g\|_{2}\|h\|_{2}-\frac{L_{J}\eta^{2}}{2}\|h\|_{2}^{2}.

This proves the desired lower bound. If

p0​μ>LJ​η​(‖g‖2​‖h‖2+12​‖h‖22),p_{0}\mu>L_{J}\eta\left(\|g\|_{2}\|h\|_{2}+\frac{1}{2}\|h\|_{2}^{2}\right),

then the right-hand side is strictly positive, and therefore

Jtask​(θco+)>Jtask​(θstat+).J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{co}}^{+})>J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta_{\mathrm{stat}}^{+}).

∎

Remark 4 (Interpretation).

Theorem 5 isolates the source of the co-evolution gain. The key quantity is a judge-gated local condition on the reflections that are
actually accepted for reuse. Under this condition, policy training improves accepted reflection utility, and accepted reflection training
improves task performance. Moreover, the joint update on Jtask+UJ_{\mathrm{task}}+U yields a strictly larger first-order gain in adapted task
value than task-only training with a static memory objective. This is the precise sense in which jointly training the evolving memory policy
is stronger than inference-time-only static memory. The co-evolution effect survives because gg and hh still live in the same shared
parameter space: a task update changes the future reflection generator, and a reflection update changes the future task policy.

Remark 5 (Why parameter sharing matters).

The first-order co-evolution mechanism above is specific to the shared-backbone design. If rollout generation and reflection generation were
parameterized by disjoint blocks θ=(θπ,θref)\theta=(\theta_{\pi},\theta_{\mathrm{ref}}) with JtaskJ_{\mathrm{task}} depending only on
θπ\theta_{\pi} and UU depending only on θref\theta_{\mathrm{ref}}, then

∇Jtask​(θ)=(gπ,0),∇U​(θ)=(0,href),\nabla J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta)=(g_{\pi},0),\qquad\nabla U(\theta)=(0,h_{\mathrm{ref}}),

and hence

⟨∇Jtask​(θ),∇U​(θ)⟩=0.\left\langle\nabla J_{\mathrm{task}}(\theta),\nabla U(\theta)\right\rangle=0.

Thus the mutual-improvement phenomenon in Theorem 5 disappears at first order in the fully decoupled case. This formalizes why a unified
backbone can support genuine co-evolution, rather than merely wrapping a static memory module around a separately trained policy.


Appendix F Experiment Details

We largely follow the experimental setup of DR Tulu [shao2025dr] for training, evaluation, infrastructure, and baseline selection, adapting
where necessary to support our proposed components. Below, we provide the specific details.

One additional hyperparameter is the stage-dependent matrix Λ\Lambda mentioned in Section˜3.3, which we set to be

The training data is the same DR. Tulu RL dataset (rl-research/dr-tulu-rl-data), which contains ∼{\sim}4.9K diverse deep research queries.
All ablation runs (Baseline RL, SS-GRPO, full RubricEM) use the same 600-step budget with 2 nodes, starting from the same RubricEM-SFT
checkpoint. The final RubricEM run uses 4 nodes for longer runs.

Reward design.

Since the focus of this work is to improve open-ended answer quality through LLM-as-judge feedback, we use only rubric-based judge signals as
RL rewards. Concretely, task-policy rewards come from the evolving stagewise rubrics used by the judge, and reflection-policy rewards come
from judge scores over rubric-grounded reflections. We intentionally do not add auxiliary verifiable rewards, such as format rewards,
citation rewards, or tool-use heuristics, which have been used in prior deep research RL recipes such as DR Tulu [shao2025dr]. This choice
isolates the open-ended component of the problem: improvements should come from better semantic planning, research, synthesis, and experience
reuse, rather than from optimizing easily checkable surface constraints. We believe future work could further improve performance by
combining rubric-based rewards with calibrated citation, grounding, or formatting rewards, but our current design provides a cleaner and more
holistic setting for studying RL beyond verifiable rewards.


F.2 Evaluation Details

F.2.1 Long-Form Benchmarks

We evaluate on four long-form benchmarks:

  * •

    HealthBench [arora2025healthbench]: Subsampled1000 medical questions spanning patient consultations, clinical guidelines, and health
    advice. Evaluation uses an LLM-as-judge (GPT-4) that grades each response against per-question rubrics on multiple axes (accuracy,
    completeness, context awareness, communication). The reported score is the overall rubric satisfaction rate.

  * •

    ResearchQA [yifei2025researchqa]: 756 scientific research questions with expert-authored rubric items. Evaluation uses an LLM-as-judge
    (GPT-4) that assesses coverage of each rubric item on a 5-point scale (Not at all / Barely / Moderately / Mostly / Completely). The
    reported score is the average normalized coverage.

  * •

    DeepResearchBench (DRB) [du2025deepresearch]: 100 complex research questions requiring long-form reports with citations. Evaluation uses
    RACE (Report Assessment via Citation Evaluation) scoring, which combines content quality and citation accuracy. The judge (Gemini)
    evaluates both the substance of the report and whether citations are accurate and well-grounded.

  * •

    ResearchRubrics [sharma2026researchrubrics]: 101 open-ended deep research prompts across diverse real-world domains, each paired with
    expert-written, prompt-specific rubrics. Evaluation uses an LLM-as-judge to assess rubric compliance under fine-grained criteria covering
    factual grounding, reasoning soundness, synthesis quality, relevance, clarity, and citation use. Rubric items include both positive and
    negative criteria with different weights, and the reported score is the binary score.

F.2.2 Short-Form Benchmarks

We additionally evaluate on four short-form benchmarks to test out-of-domain transfer:

  * •

    SimpleQA [wei2024measuring]: 1,000 factual questions with exact-match evaluation via LLM grading (correct / incorrect / not attempted).

  * •

    2WikiMultihopQA [ho2020constructing]: 1000 multi-hop reasoning questions requiring evidence from multiple sources. LLM-as-judge
    evaluation.

  * •

    WebWalker [wu2025webwalker]: 680 web navigation questions. LLM-as-judge evaluation.

  * •

    DeepSearchQA (DSQA) [gupta2026deepsearchqa]: 900 search-intensive questions with exact-match grading.

All short-form benchmarks are evaluated in zero-shot using the same agent pipeline and search tools as the long-form benchmarks. No
short-form data is used during RL training, making these evaluations fully out-of-domain.

Note on Benchmarks.

Unlike Dr. Tulu, we do not include the SQAv2 (ScholarQA) benchmark [asai2024openscholar, bragg2025astabench] in our evaluation. SQAv2 is
highly citation-centric: it primarily measures whether a model can produce precise inline citations to specific academic papers, which
corresponds more to the verifiable citation-grounding component of deep research than to the open-ended answer-quality setting studied here.
Our RL objective intentionally uses only rubric-based judge rewards and does not include citation-specific rewards, so SQA-v2 would test a
capability that our method is not designed to directly optimize. This does not mean that citation quality is absent from our evaluation:
several of the remaining long-form benchmarks, such as ResearchQA and ResearchRubrics, still include citation-, grounding-, or
evidence-use-related rubric items. However, these benchmarks evaluate citation use as one part of broader long-form answer quality rather
than making precise academic citation the dominant objective. In addition, during SFT data generation, Gemini-3.1-Pro produces few and often
unreliable academic citations even under strong prompting and rejection sampling, making it a weak teacher for this specific skill. We
therefore leave citation-specific RL and citation-heavy academic evaluation as future work, and focus here on improving semantic quality,
coverage, reasoning, and synthesis beyond verifiable rewards.

Additional notes. For a fair comparison with baselines, the main results in Table˜1, the RL ablations in Figure˜5, and the short-form
transfer results in Table˜2 are evaluated with direct zero-shot prompts: we do not append rubric-bank entries, previous reflections, or
other experience examples at test time. The agent still follows the same benchmark protocol and uses the same external search tools when the
task requires tool use. Thus, the reported gains are not simply due to giving RubricEM extra reflection context during evaluation. Although
the task policy uses reflection context during RL training, the main evaluations test the resulting task policy directly, suggesting that
reflection-conditioned training likely results in higher-quality rollouts. We separately study inference-time experience reuse in Figure˜6(c),
where rubric-bank entries are explicitly injected during evaluation.


F.3 Infrastructure

Our training and evaluation infrastructure builds on the DR Tulu codebase [shao2025dr], which provides the Ray-based distributed RL training
loop, vLLM integration for rollout generation, asynchronous tool calling, sample packing, and one-step asynchronous training [noukhovitch2024asynchronous].
We use GRPO [shao2024deepseekmath] with token-level loss aggregation, tool output token masking [jin2025searchr1], and a small KL penalty
(0.001) for stability. Full hyperparameters are provided in the RL training table above.

We extend the base infrastructure in several ways to support RubricEM:

  * •

    Stagewise scoring pipeline: An asynchronous stagewise judge scoring module runs Gemini API calls in parallel with the training loop.
    Rubric generation (32 calls per step) and trajectory scoring (256 calls per step) are parallelized using asyncio.gather with
    exponential-backoff retries (see Appendix C).

  * •

    Meta-policy training pipeline: Reflection generation and meta-policy training are integrated via a three-thread architecture with
    one-step deferred reflection training, where reflection samples from step NN are trained in Phase A of step N+1N{+}1 while the inference
    engine generates new rollouts. This adds effectively no extra wall-clock overhead (see Appendix D).

  * •

    Rubric bank module: A thread-safe in-memory store with a FAISS index over query embeddings (Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B on CPU). Bank operations
    (retrieval, prompt injection, and background reflection generation) are integrated into the data preparation thread with one-step
    deferred execution (see Appendix D).

  * •

    Checkpoint management: In addition to standard model and optimizer checkpoints (via DeepSpeed), we save the rubric buffer state, rubric
    bank contents, and dataloader state at regular intervals to enable seamless training resumption with consistent memory and data ordering.

For evaluation, we use vLLM to serve the model checkpoint on a single GPU and run the agent pipeline with real-time tool execution via the
MCP backend. Each benchmark evaluation varies around 2–18 hours depending on the number of examples, the complexity of the query, judging
latency, and the average number of tool calls per trajectory.

Search tools.

We expose two search tools to the agent. The primary tool is google_search, implemented through Gemin-3-Flash (as the browsing model) with
Google Search grounding enabled111https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/google-search. It returns AI-synthesized summaries with grounding
snippets, and is mainly used for general web search, fact-seeking questions, and broad real-world information gathering. The second tool is
snippet_search, implemented through the Semantic Scholar API222https://api.semanticscholar.org/api-docs. It retrieves text snippets from
academic papers and is mainly used when the query requires scholarly evidence, paper-level context, or scientific literature support. Both
tools are called through the same MCP backend, and their outputs are wrapped in <tool_output> blocks before being returned to the agent.


F.4 Baselines

We compare against baselines from three categories, following the selection of Dr. Tulu [shao2025dr] and supplementing with additional recent
models. Scores for existing baselines are taken from the Dr. Tulu paper where available; for models not covered, we run the same evaluation
pipeline.

  * •

    Closed deep research models: Proprietary systems with full deep research capabilities, including OpenAI Deep Research [openai2025deepresearch],
    Gemini Deep Research [google2025gemini], Perplexity Deep Research [perplexity2025sonardeepresearch], Claude Sonnet Search, Gemini 3.1 Pro
    + Search, and GPT-5 + Search.

  * •

    Fixed pipeline deep research models: Models that use a fixed multi-stage pipeline (search →\rightarrow synthesis →\rightarrow report)
    without end-to-end RL training, including WebThinker [li2025webweaver] and Ai2 ScholarQA [singh2025ai2].

  * •

    Open deep research models: Open-weight models trained end-to-end for deep research, including Search-R1-7B [jin2025searchr1],
    WebExplorer-8B [liu2025webexplorer], Tongyi DeepResearch-30B-A3B [tongyi2025deepresearch], and DR Tulu-8B [shao2025dr] (both SFT and RL
    checkpoints).

DR Tulu is the most direct comparison, since we use the same training data and operate in the same open deep research setting. Compared to
Dr. Tulu, RubricEM uses a different search tool (Google Search with Gemini grounding vs. Serper API) and a different SFT teacher
(Gemini-3.1-Pro vs. GPT-5). Our search tool provides richer AI-synthesized summaries but fewer raw webpage URLs; their teacher is stronger
but their search tool returns shorter snippets. We discuss this trade-off in the main text and control for it through ablation studies that
isolate the contribution of our training recipe from search tool effects.

Appendix H Limitations and Discussions
--------------------------------------

Limitations.

Our experiments involve long-horizon agentic RL with search tool calls and external LLM judging, which makes the training loop more sensitive
to infrastructure instability than standard offline RL or supervised fine-tuning. During training, we occasionally observed API delays and
inconsistent network connections, so wall-clock execution and some rollout–judge latencies were not perfectly controlled across all RL
steps. In the main large-scale RL run, the training server also had to be shut down and restarted several times. Although we restored
training from checkpoints, such interruptions can introduce additional staleness in the asynchronous reflection branch, rubric bank, and
judge-feedback pipeline beyond the intended one-step lag. We therefore view our reported results as reflecting a realistic but not fully
ideal infrastructure setting; in principle, a more stable, uninterrupted training environment could reduce stale feedback and further improve
the efficiency of our method. Another limitation is that we use Gemini Flash as a cost-effective judge for rubric generation, stagewise
scoring, and reflection evaluation. A stronger or more specialized judge could likely provide more accurate stage-level credit and
higher-quality reflection rewards, especially for subtle long-form research tasks, but would also increase cost and latency. Exploring the
scaling behavior of RubricEM with stronger judges, multiple judges, or calibrated judge ensembles is an important direction for future work.

Discussion and broader impact.

More broadly, our results suggest that LLM-generated rubrics should be treated not only as evaluation artifacts, but as a general interface
for structuring agent behavior, assigning semantic credit, and accumulating reusable experience. They also point to a training-time view of
Meta-RL for language agents: rather than using reflection, memory, or self-improvement only as inference-time prompting mechanisms, one can
train a meta-policy during RL so that judged experience directly shapes both the agent’s parameters and its reusable textual memory. While
we study open-ended deep research beyond verifiable rewards, the same recipe may transfer to other domains where quality is multidimensional
and hard to reduce to exact-answer correctness, such as writing assistance, data analysis, scientific review, tutoring, and complex tool-use
workflows. At the same time, rubric-guided meta-policies inherit the risks of their judges and rubrics: poorly specified criteria can
reinforce shallow preferences, biased standards, or overconfident synthesis, and reusable memories may propagate these errors across tasks.
Future work should study more robust rubric generation, stronger or ensemble judges, human-auditable rubric banks, uncertainty-aware
reflection training, and safety-aware criteria for domains where agentic research outputs may influence real decisions.
